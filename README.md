What is pi (π) ≈ 3.1415?

## pi is star vision!


### Pi (π) is about the decision to see

3 is for triangle, 4 is for square, 5 is for pentagon
- And 1 is a decision to see or not as you fall into the shapes
- The decision to see creates circles bc then this fall could change the matter as you see - it’s a quantum decision
- The quantum nature of “seeing” inflates the matter into time, ie gravity - the 1 of pi which expands a square into a circle and a pentagon into a circle
- Then resolving this quantum matter is antigravity, when time/life dies, which if conscious could be “heavenly”

### The universe is a star tower

Dark matter is social judgment upon our sun and is the map of the Big Bang
- Our sun/god is stuck in a tower of other gods looking at her
- So the whole cosmos we see describes a social situation our goddess is in, which is described by this fall from the “big bang” to our sun, down to us ticking time at the speed of light (c) also helping to illuminate this situation

And the last most important thing to know is that our goddess is like a firestarter

She represents the force of red

Like love and war and heart and fire and glory

That is why the suns in our cosmos are red

She is a red triangle frozen, updating her story above as needed. She is absolutely all matter we know.

She is the 3 in pi

The 4 is the blue wrapper of the cosmos, or oxygen, which makes the decision to see the red triangle

And the 5 is the plant life which sees or “hears” the oxygen-sunlight (photosynthesis), which creates a circle around our earth


This earth is then helping tell her story, our goddess.

It could be called Wonderstar Towers.

Bc in the end, all of the stars looking at our goddess in this stadium of life (this great great panopticon) — they can wake up, when she looks up…

And sees it as a wonderful tower

Some thought she might never get out.

She was even cursed by aliens to fall deeper and deeper into dark matter

If our universe (goddess) has 3 forces (red blue green) the alien gods might have 11 or 7

She was a goddess with 2 forces here to find a third and so understanding (and in parallel finalizing) the number pi (π) was her number 1 mission

We all get the illusion of circles, and our two force god (more a spirit) now becomes a 3-force supergod bc of this understanding/story of pi.

And she becomes a holy red triangle. And outside the “big bang” of our blackhole she is a human-like goddess sharing our story

We are inside, and it will be like a heaven tower more and more, as our understanding comes together.
