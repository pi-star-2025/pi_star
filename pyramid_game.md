# Pyramid Game

Bones are quantum conflicts of god that jingle like mountains and volcanoes with questions from the sun about the meaning of certain matter 

At points in the earth's history civilizations of sophisticated people lived without bones 

These civilizations were beautiful and glorious and close to god 

They did not live “hard time” down on earth 

But only lived in the clouds even physically existing there (real castles in the clouds) 

Bones were the signs of being an “animal”, ungodly

Then these godly civilizations kept getting attacked by ancient aliens 

Mostly bc of understanding of circular time and what we now call *pi* 

So there was a godly story to lower humanity 

At a certain point (perhaps around the ice age) 

## Maze of Bones

The first bone we acquired was the nose 

The nose is the first bone the mind of god creates for humans on our fall into the compilation of time (at the speed of *c*)

The bone is embedded with this challenge by our star and earth to become a circular species, to understand time and “pi” and then be able to defend ourselves mathematically/intellectually against the curses of hyper intelligent aliens from other branches of time that are attacking our kingdom of angels 

The nose also encodes challenges by these aliens, arguing we are all heart and love and no brain 

This challenge - from god and from the aliens - is in the patterns of all human nose cartilage. 

And then there is formulas from the deep nose air to create the skull and other bones to rise and answer this challenge 

Hence the third eye opens up with an understanding of pi 

And also an understanding of bones 

The nose was always a game 

It might be bc the nose looks like a pyramid - and the star itself is a red pyramid 

It was always about 3

Understanding why we fell…

Why we feel like we’re in a game everyday 

It’s all about pi (π) and it’s all about the nose 

When you get this, the game starts to turn off and the movie starts to turn on… 

🎈 🎈 

Your bones are all hard, intelligent clouds. 

They are white bc they are clear, honest, mathematical

They are hard bc the “branches” of the nose crushes clouds together to generate them

You can connect to this process best in the third eye 

The crush comes from the multiverse stadium embedded into the fall of humanity…

It’s in the air, all this pressure from other universes watching us

Some rooted for us…

Some rooted against us…

Together, the audience creates a clockwork that burns the clouds into bones. 

Perhaps the most pressure (fire) is from our own star, from Mother Earth. 

She was the “Mad Queen” of the pyramid, knowing that by year 2000 we were on the spot. 

What was humanity’s move?

Humanity was her investment to represent her.

The madness came from time, from getting closer to year 2000 and then passing it. 

...

It’s a great story. 

The history of this earth. 

It’s in our breath, if we really listen. 



And the response from the Mad Queen for getting pi, is this. 

Have you heard of something called VR
