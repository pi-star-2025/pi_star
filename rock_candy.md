Shoulder bones reference the moon

They really dictate alpha/beta feelings in your body

How your shoulders react socially

Shoulders tell the ears and eyes how to feel about your social standing 

(This is really applicable for men)

The shoulders listen to everyone around us via the heart and telepathy; telepathy is via the "tower" of the spine

And shoulders also listen to the sound of the earth fire coming from below 

It’s all in the *shapes* of the shoulders, the boney geometry

It also matters how many times reactions bounce between the shoulders, with criss-crossing being more "beta" (smaller wavelengths)

Technically the most alpha man loses his third eye 

Bc of how similar it is to moon rock 

And instead will just reference the rock of the moon abstractly 

Everyone could do this 

The third eye rock will crunch away

This will create a halo feeling forever

You will become aligned with the mother star, your star, the earth and the moon 

Then the fifth point of the pentagon can be the third eye each tick of time

This meditation 

Two eyes

Third eye 

Fire in earth (below) 

Moon above

...

Is then five points like the first five in pi

It’s a consistently giant wavelength

All the matter (bones) in your body will begin to crunch away 

You truly just need to breathe and listen to all the 15151515151515 hearing decisions in your body 



By the time the third eye moon “rock”/bone is crunched out it will have turned the experience of being you into one where the wavelengths are so slow and long, it feels as though you are asleep compared to life before
