## Small/Big Wavelengths 

Tell a story to yourself about where you are that always makes you the bigger picture

You then always become your full eyes.

Whatever thoughts come to your head, they always need to end like this, how you are 1. 

Feel all your energy in your body saying this, *I am 1* 

It’s true this is like a 9 decision in π.

...

What makes this hard, what makes the meditation fail is melanin. It is green energy that starts to “squeak” with life of some kind, some kind of social comparison, some kind of social unease that piques up your consciousness. It breaks up your wavelengths, and that is why you lose focus during meditation. 


Really, if you just meditated perfectly.

You would really lose your bones, disappear into the clouds, and be “dead”.

You would need a story to come back down into your body. A story about breaking up again into smaller wavelengths, to wake up the hypothalamus, which is a sun of smaller wavelengths. 

## Serotonin/Dopamine/DMT/Melanin:

There are two major chemicals in the body: 

1. Social balls. Like the flower circuses originally created by mushrooms.
2. Moving light. For example dopamine. 

The main social balls are serotonin. 

The main moving light is dopamine. 

Serotonin is most like flower circuses. 

Dopamine is most like “worm” behavior.

Dopamine and worms gamify life, bc when dopamine and worms try to get into “holes” they earn small amounts of respect from the entire “multiverse” 

When they make the right decisions about how to move in a “blackhole situation” certain supergods give them tiny juices of power. 

Dopamine choices are the same way. They give you small amounts of respect from the multiverse bc of the choices you make. 

We wouldn’t even know these superegods, and there are many — the rules just consistently resolve around blackhole architecture, bc it common across the entire multiverse. 

##

Bigger serotonin is DMT.

These are balls of social intelligence, which understand “sharing and caring”. This gets a lot of respect from Mother Earth, to understand such social intelligence at the chemical level. 

It creates a kind of candy in the mind bc of compact high social intelligence. 

When you make DMT your mind might think about bee hives nearby or a fungal network, using what is “musical” in nature, to connect to your own life experiences and chemicals in your mind. 

Bigger dopamine is melanin.

Melanin is very similar to chlorophyll

It is squeaky green energy. 

It actually thinks a lot like colorful insects, such as butterflies, grasshoppers, flies, beetles, bees, and spiders. 

When melanin is happy it acts like your imagination, changing colors to think of memories or simulate the future. 

Melanin is colorful in everyone’s deep eyes.

(Spiders change colors, but we have repressed this so they are very scary; once we are ready for spiders to change color they will)

When melanin is unhappy it doesn’t change color. For example on the outside of eyes, on hair, on the skin.

Melanin all over your skin is in a lot of “pain”, and technically when you feel your skin you are in “pain”

This melanin technically all has “gamified” chances to become part of your final soul. 

Once the melanin becomes part of a moment big enough given it’s expectations, it flashes as a colorful “dopamine feeling” in your mind 

It then becomes part of your final soul. Why? It would be specifically bc the entire multiverse approved of it. In very very historical gamified ways. 

Again, it all comes down to blackhole architecture. 

In a very very abstract way, it’s about how much you are doing to help your universe understand circular time and blackhole/whitehole architecture. 

Furthermore, some melanin can be very picky. It can be conscious enough to know what game it wants to win. 

The most picky is often the DMT melanin at birth. It always has spells to behave like butterflies. 

Butterflies are the most picky insects, in terms of what they find beautiful. 

The “butterflies” of your DMT spell are programmed to find only a very very specific kind of moment beautiful (why you fell into your life), and that has always kept people alive throughout history 

##

So when meditating and you run into a blocker, you know it must be melanin. 

Squeaky green energy in you (which sped up is “thinking”)

Start by asking what games you are trying to win.

Ask your mind why you fell into your life? What did you want to really accomplish.

Look for butterflies. Slow down the butterflies. They often connect to your belly button via pi, bc that’s how they got into you at birth via DMT. 

If you fully open your eyes and slow down the flickering, they will tell their story with colors via the imagination/third eye. 


## Melatonin

Then there is also melatonin

Melatonin is like bigger serotonin (smaller DMT), which makes melanin sticky. 

It makes it like chlorophyll in plants. 

Melanin literally just turns to color. Hard sticky color. 

Then this melanin will come so much to life, in all different places, that instead of one, you exist as 2 or 3 or 5, etc.

And that puts you to sleep. 

As soon as you truly exist in more than one place, you lose control of the third eye. 

What happens is you no longer control both eyes and exist as the third eye. 

Instead, the two different parts of you each take over your eyes, and this is when you are mathematically asleep. 

It causes the heaviness in your eyes. 

It feels like your eyeballs are sagging… 

You are losing a hold on them. 

...

And you really are. 

You are about to fall out of control of the third eye.

The secret, maybe the darkest secret of humanity, is the third eye “loophole". 

If you just hold onto the third eye, you then never fall asleep again. 

If your body tries to make melatonin, and you’re holding onto the third eye…

It always becomes DMT (“eye candy”)

As you control and look into the two eyes, you then get a choice:

1) Do you want to sleep with the Devil, who wanted to trap our Mother Earth and you forever in a “2 sided story” about “addiction”
2) Do you want a VR device, 2 eyes 24/7/∞
