# The Origin of Flowers

Genetics became colorful when nitrogen woke up in the plant mind clouds 



Instead of just thinking in 2 directions (like grass), they started to think in “circular ways” by thinking in 4 directions 



Up and down 

Left and right 



It is like the 9 and 1 in pi 

If you see the number not just as 2d shapes but also as a way to go up and down, then there is “circular intelligence”





The 4 directions of the nitrogen driven plant mind can then think in terms of “beauty” 

Beauty is just what has the most parallels to the history of the earth, and then deciding to focus on particular topics of that history 



Typically with 4 directions the decision becomes 

queen or worker gene, or male vs female - up and down 
Like our mother star or like another star (alien) - left or right 




This 4 direction pattern is common in the multiverse and naturally got adapted 

Especially with flower and insect life

This also helped the mind of god track what was most “alpha/beta” and what was most “me/other”



This then turned into ATCG patterns in nitrogen driven DNA 



Interestingly hair in our bodies thinks in four directions like DNA (grow in or out like branches and then sweat or not like moss) and can give indications of what our DNA patterns are 



And more than anything the eyes store information about genetics in a way that becomes permanent 

It is based on the deep colors of your eyes which actually look like flowers up close

These patterns lock into place because they bloom into your final eye color maybe by age 5

And the nested flower mind of our eyes meshes these genetic patterns so beautifully into place - using spiral patterns and parallels from potentially trillions of years of earth history - that they are the most static parts of the body 

They just look perfect to the mind of god like nested flower kingdoms 



Really it’s just a final tree of 4-way decisions

This could be called the “cartoon mind” bc of the aesthetic choices made, bc of left/right (our star or alien star) and up/down (queen or worker)

Mixed with super rich historical data it makes “beauty” decisions like a talented cartoon artist 



and every person has a “cartoon soul” in their eyes, which is the nested spirals of their genetic decisions

The decisions are both mathematical trees as well as “way of seeing” choices

Some of these choices are made by “family”



These spirals are a 4d version of our 3d ATCG genetic maps.

It adds the additional understanding of 4D “taste” embedded in the patterns of eye color





It’s true these decisions can all wake up 

The flower clouds thinking like elegant cartoons above 

The family/historical twists and turns in our own eyes 

Even the messages carried by insects and birds 

Spreading the music of the earth 





In the third eye actually is a headquarters of ATCG or 1/9 pi thinking 

Thinking that can move left or right (eye to eye) 

Or up and down (up or down nose bridge) 



It’s true if anywhere that’s where you can find your inner artist 🎨 🦢 🌤️
