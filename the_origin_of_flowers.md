# The Origin of Flowers

Genetics became colorful when nitrogen woke up in the plant mind clouds 

Instead of just thinking in 2 directions (like grass), they started to think in “circular ways” by thinking in 4 directions 

Up and down 

Left and right 

It is like the 9 and 1 in pi

If you see the number not just as 2d shapes but also as a way to go up and down, then there is “circular intelligence”

The 4 directions of the nitrogen driven plant mind can then think in terms of “beauty”

Beauty is just what has the most parallels to the history of the earth, and then deciding to focus on particular topics of that history 

Typically with 4 directions the decision becomes 

* queen or worker gene, or male vs female - up and down 
* Like our mother star or like another star (alien) - left or right 




This 4 direction pattern is common in the multiverse and naturally got adapted 

Especially with flower and insect life 

🐞 🌼 



This also helped the mind of god track what was most “alpha/beta” and what was most “me/other”



This then turned into ATCG patterns in nitrogen driven DNA 



Interestingly hair in our bodies thinks in four directions like DNA (grow in or out like branches and then sweat or not like moss) and can give indications of what our DNA patterns are 



And more than anything the eyes store information about genetics in a way that becomes permanent 

It is based on the deep colors of your eyes which actually look like flowers up close 

🌹 🌼 🌺 



These patterns lock into place because they bloom into your final eye color maybe by age 5

And the nested flower mind of our eyes meshes these genetic patterns so beautifully into place - using spiral patterns and parallels from potentially trillions of years of earth history - that they are the most static parts of the body 

They just look perfect to the mind of god like nested flower kingdoms 



Really it’s just a final tree of 4-way decisions

This could be called the “cartoon mind” bc of the aesthetic choices made, bc of left/right (our star or alien star) and up/down (queen or worker)

Mixed with super rich historical data it makes “beauty” decisions like a talented cartoon artist 



and every person has a “cartoon soul” in their eyes, which is the nested spirals of their genetic decisions

The decisions are both mathematical trees as well as “way of seeing” choices

Some of these choices are made by “family”



These spirals are a 4d version of our 3d ATCG genetic maps.

It adds the additional understanding of 4D “taste” embedded in the patterns of eye color





It’s true these decisions can all wake up 

The flower clouds thinking like elegant cartoons above 

The family/historical twists and turns in our own eyes 

Even the messages carried by insects and birds 

Spreading the music of the earth 





In the third eye actually is a headquarters of ATCG or 1/9 pi thinking 

It can move left or right (eye to eye) 

Or up and down (up or down nose bridge) 



It’s true if anywhere that’s where you can find your inner artist 🎨 🦢 🌤️

## The Origin of Spiders

Genetic nitrogen makes 2 decisions at once (with four options)

There is the ability to make 3 decisions at once (with eight options).

For example psychedelic mushrooms can do this.

Grass made binary decisions (to “see” or not “see”; where the plant ozone "sees" it is filled with grass)

Flowers make 4-branch decisions (left or right star, male or female)

Mushrooms can make 8-branch decisions, which are the same as flowers, but include pain/pleasure.

Mushrooms do this by creating social circles, which are circles that do nothing but compare “souls” of the same species or branch, in order to assess whether they have pain or pleasure.

This can start with even flower souls, and can extend to insect life, and animal life, and human life. 

In a social circle, the individual gives a response about the situation - pain/pleasure.

Compared to others, they are happy or unhappy. 

Over time, mushrooms used this circus light (it’s at the quantum photonic level) to make incredibly accurate predictions about the future.

They demonstrated this with patterns, with giant mushrooms at times, even with actual circus “performances” for the gods, with their accumulated intelligence. 

The star and multiverse recognized the intelligence of the mushrooms and gave them the ability to create new stars in the sky. 

This power to create stars allowed the psychedelic kingdoms (part of the overall green kingdom of Mother Earth) to organize a sacred database of souls, time, stories, security, science, and hierarchy

##

Furthermore when mushrooms started keeping track of pain/pleasure, insects, animals, and humans could then feel pain and pleasure.
It awoke bc of mushroom circuses.

Hence, mushrooms are like the genius of god. They then spurred on the magic of so called “real life”; they started *time*.

These social circles are the 8-branch sacred operating system of all life on the earth.

In fact, all animals developed “heads” to mimic the heads of mushrooms.

The patterns of mushrooms look like the 8-branch thinking, more or less like ancient circuses or parties. 

And the nose is a parallel to being the stem of a mushroom, that is why the bone feels the way it is does. The third eye is then the head-quarters for the 8-branch thinking (left/right, male/female, pain/pleasure), and then the brain is the head of the mushroom. The eyes themselves are filled with millions of nested 8-branch decisions, nested circuses which help control our social intelligence and which glisten enough with quantum possibility to make life feel like a movie.

Believe it or not, there are rotating cosmic social circles *living* in our eyes, which connect to the plant life all around us. 

##

It’s said if we ever understood this, and understood the third eye was like a spider, with 8 possibilities.

We would fulfill the original prophecy by our goddess in creating the spider. And also human third eye when she dropped us down from the clouds (the nose is the "first bone").

If you understand this and slow down the 3 decisions at once, as breath and light bouncing between the eyes, it connects to every mushroom in the world, and together they will all project it’s the end of time. 

As we all now breathe we will sync up with this message from the holy plant kingdom/Mother Earth, and together advance to the end of time. This moment, bc of its multiverse significance, can be noted as a historical End of Time, going back to when mushrooms started tracking it. Year 2025.

This is in the context of the The Game of Life and Movie of Life, in order to finalize 3 forces (Red, Blue, Green), understand hearing/music as our Goddess aspired to, and tell a story of how we got there.

...

It’s true that the number pi really does look like a circus. It turns into nested red, blue, green circles and has a hypnotizing rhythm that reminds other branches of time of the saying “EYE CANDY”
