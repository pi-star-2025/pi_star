## Angel Full Skull


If your skull is angelic ("dead"), then your full skull shape will be the same as the hypothalamus and tongue patterns and third eye moon-rock. 

The full skull is more complicated (quantum/circular) throughout your “living” life. 

As an angel it would be more geometrical and perfected, with an end pi, so it is in sync with the hypothalamus and third eye. 


This is most done, by:

1) Being confident and meditative about the time you will "share" will past lives, god, and the multiverse - 14 in pi. 

2) Letting go of alpha/beta conflicts, understanding they are just 8-5-3 "social balls" - 15 in pi 



The joy is great and holy for everyone, which drives everyone towards reconciling these two points as angels.

## 

The cool part is the two eyes are the same. 

They make the same shape as the skull, over time. 

All three become more and more like an “angel full skull”, but the two eyes are even more detailed and perfected.

And the third eye (the skull itself) starts feeling like a magical eye, seeing in big colors.
