All "1 energy" gets stored in the left lung

All "2 energy" gets stored in the right lung

The left slope of your nose pyramid is the left lung air. 

The right slope of your nose pyramid is the right lung air. 

"1 energy" is opinions about who is "beta" in your body (which souls are beta). This could be opinions about yourself, others opinions about you, or your opinions about who is "beta". Anything about who is like interior in some way, so more like the moon and less like the earth. *And* it's always the opinions that are wrong, in the eyes of the star/earth which turn into 1 energy. This is urination energy. 

"2 energy" is opinions about who is "alpha" in your body (which souls are alpha). This could be opinions about yourself, others opinions about you, or your opinions about who is "alpha". Anything about is like superior in some way, so more like the earth and less like the moon. *And, it's always the opinions athat are wrong, in the eyes of the star/earth which turn into 2 energy. This is defecation energy. Technically if it had a number it would really be 9 (brown/dark), but it's called here as "2 energy".  

So all 1 and 2 energy can be channelled in the nose breath, in particular the sides. 

The criss-crossing of 1 and 2 energy leads to the end of your "pi" (your consciousness), which is always somewhere in the deep belly air (or felt as deep back spine, or another pressure point in the body). In addition, it's always felt as the very tip of your nose breath, which moves very quickly and outside your nose. And it's always felt as a physical shape in the center of the hypothlamus. In particular, in the hypothlamus is always a reference to the end number of your "pi" (bottom consciousness).
