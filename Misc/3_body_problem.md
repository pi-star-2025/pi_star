## Eye Candy

The 3 body problem can be solved with "Eye Candy", a gimmicky but effective solution bc it can come with significant energy savings. 

Create a third body, the first two stars want to look at (via a shared "way of seeing" like Ï€)

Then the space/time locations of all 3 bodies get intertwined bc of this "way of seeing" and how "addicting" the third body is to look at.

It can be Red/Green/Blue, or another Eye Candy solution.
