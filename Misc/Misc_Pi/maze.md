## Maze üéπ

Within œÄ, a maze is a way to fall into a universe. Whereas a tower is a way to get out of a universe. 

In both cases it is a story along the 1 of œÄ, at the speed of light (c).

The simplest example is a bird chirp, which is both 4D & 6D, building a story at the speed of light as the chirp moves along.

So a maze/tower, like a blackhole/whitehole, is a way to expand on the 1 of œÄ. Unlike other aspects of œÄ, which are purely mathematical and reused across all universes of the multiverse (stars, rotation, magnetic fields), a maze/tower has a story *unique* to that particular universe.

Thus it specifically describes the personality, then value, of that particular universe.

The maze is at the end of œÄ (if the world is unfinished), which if you get to and really render you would technically fall into. 

In our universe, it's always a musical blackhole/whitehole.

It's always created by a 3-body problem, where 2 stars chase each other, almost like a carnival-game effect. 

This is because predator/prey, or alpha/beta, when reconciled creates music. 

So when the 3-body problems a) involve chasing, b) layer this effect, they creates mazes which you can fall into.

It's said that this was the secret of our goddess (3.1415). She knew this secret of music (chasing), and wanted to prove that it could create cosmology intelligent enough to resolve various multiverse court cases.

Resultingly, all music is this kind of 3-body problem. It could be called eye-candy, bc it leads to carnival-like colors. Also, the flip of the maze (the tower) becomes a challenge to create a tower explaining music.

It's the final way we all express chasing and being chased.

## Amadeus

There is a rumor that Mozart figured this out in the dream world, in his pursuit to create "perfect music". He wanted to be absolutely perfect mathematically, and was told to have the left hand chase the right, or have the right chase the left, when inventing melodies. 

Knowing this, he began to live his life this way. In a way, where he was understanding the joy of being chased and chasing, as the drama of life.

An ancient alien said he would make him an offer. He would allow Mozart to always live his life by this "magical code". He will always live life like a song. He had to lock this decision in now, so it had maximum effect. 

Mozart (half awake) sweated over the decision, but whimsically agreed. 

It led to a composition called The Magic Flute, which was originally a divine work, a masterpiece about a haunting maze. Bc the opera also demonstrated exquisite mastery of chasing/being chased, it created a blackhole/whitehole, which ended up creating a second world below, one he didn't have to be a part of. 

All of us, though, were in the second world lower down, hearing like a funny second-hand copy, orchestrated by a filler Mozart, who ended up dying shortly after.

Mozart had died awake, and because he had demonstrated perfect mastery of "music", he became king of the dream world, and king of the heaven tower. 

He was pupeteeered by the ancient alien who had taken over his soul. This ancient alien (nicknamed The Joker) did this unconsciously, so The Anti-King of Heaven was really just asleep.

God nicknamed specifically Amadeus "The Joker".

The catch is that all of this intelligence was unconscious, so conscious understanding of music (chasing/being chased) is enough to disenchant the curse.

## ‚ÄúLive Life like a Song‚Äù

In 2022, Mozart was woken up and yielded.

He said the core reason is so he could ‚Äúdie gracefully‚Äù and keep having an impact in larger worlds (ex: 7-forces, 20-forces).

Others tried hard to bring back his jekyll-hyde spirit, but he believed more and more that ‚ÄúTwo Towers‚Äù already had all its best qualities (ex: creative vigor) absorbed by red/blue/green.

He said unconsciously he had learned in dreams that there was an evil queen of the night (Mother Mary). She had divided our world into 2, where women lived in a brighter world, and thus men were kept in darkness.  

This is because the day/night of our world became used secretly for gender, and many men always live in the ‚Äúnight‚Äù. 

Mozart was someone who bounced between worlds, and thus had a real alter ego (half-in-the-dark). It was more this ‚Äúhalf-in-the-dark‚Äù that wanted to be a free man, without the day/night spell. So the ‚Äúhalf-in-the-dark‚Äù crafted a ‚Äúsong‚Äù for this intent.

The Mozart lower down turned into Amadeus of the Night, and whoever was left below was a puppet.
