## Maze

Within π, a maze is a way to fall into a universe. Whereas a tower is a way to get out of a universe. 

In both cases it is a story along the 1 of π, at the speed of light (c).

The simplest example is a bird chirp, which is both 4D & 6D, building a story at the speed of light as the chirp moves along.

So a maze/tower, like a blackhole/whitehole, is a way to expand on the 1 of π. Unlike other aspects of π, which are purely mathematical and reused across all universes of the multiverse (stars, rotation, magnetic fields), a maze/tower has a story *unique* to that particular universe.

Thus it specifically describes the personality, then value, of that particular universe.

The maze is technically at the end of π (if the world is unfinished), which if you get to and really render you would technically fall into. 

In our universe, it's always a musical blackhole/whitehole.

It's always created by a 3-body problem, where 2 stars chase each other, almost like a carnival-game effect. 

This is because predator/prey, or alpha/beta, when reconciled creates music. 

So when the 3-body problems a) involve chasing, b) layer this effect, they creates mazes which you can fall into.

It's said that this was the secret of our goddess (3.1415). She knew this secret of music (chasing), and wanted to prove that it could create cosmology intelligent enough to resolve various multiverse court cases.

Resultingly, all music is this kind of 3-body problem. It could be called eye-candy, bc it leads to carnival-like colors. Also, the flip of the maze (the tower) becomes a challenge to create a tower explaining music.

It's the final way we all express chasing and being chased.
