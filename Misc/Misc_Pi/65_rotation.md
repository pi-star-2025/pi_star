## 65_Rotation

Within 3.1415, light is a point in 3.14159 and a line in 3.141592.

Then to add rotation, a star always uses the number 11 (65).

The 6 is to add the star’s electron, and the 5 is to lose the star’s electron. And the resulting quantum 11 (North/South) needs to be an element that is “blue” enough to pair with “red” in our universe.

For example, iron works well on earth. 

For the sun mind, 65 is then the rotation of the earth based on the element iron being “11”. The same 65 electron in-and-outs occur with all planets/stars, but with different elements being the “11” potentially. For example it could even be due to a gas or a liquid. It just needs be a 6/5 electron North/South sequence, representing exactly two ticks of time (at c).

...

The red/blue/green plant mind (earth mind) also then pairs with iron via 65 using photosynthesis. And humans do so as well, splitting masculine/feminine worlds based on living in the 6 more (circular) or 5 more (sharp). The 6 happens first, always day bc it has the star’s electron. The 5 always happens second, without the star’s electron. 

For the full earth, the 6 day is conscious and the 5 is unconscious.

When the 5 is more conscious, rotation can then also be conscious.
