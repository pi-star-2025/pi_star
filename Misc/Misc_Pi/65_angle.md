## 65 Angle

e represents the speed of light (over an x-y plane)
3.14 of π refers to e^2 (like a parabola)
3.1415 of π refers to e^3 (like a star)

None of these yet represent a vision-related improvement π makes over e.

3.14159265 then demonstrates how light refracts into a 45-45-90 triangle, to add value proportional to the square root of 2 (the hypotenuse of the 45-45-90 triangle, which “looks” at the 2 possibilities of the 45-45-90 triangle).

This can be demonstrated by understanding 65, including the fall from 6 to 5, is the most compact way to represent a 45-45-90 triangle with numbers.

The reason 65 is the most compact way to represent a 45-45-90 triangle is because the “fall” is the hypotenuse (i.e. the speed of light/vision of the star). From our perspective it looks like a parabola (ex: around the earth). 6 and 5 are both decisions with the power of e (e^1). 6 adds one electron. 5 falls one tick further down the speed of light. So both represent 1, and the decision between between them has the power of the square root of 2.

As you keep going down π, the numbers stack up shapes and angles that create vision. The number is complex bc the best way to represent the diagonals of shapes (or hypotenuses for triangles) is with the fall down the numbers after 3.141592. This fall represents how the speed of light (e) gets expanded by multiple branches of time, for example expanding by square root of 2 with 3.14159265.
