## Wavelets

Around 3.1415926535897932384626 of Ï€ you start to notice both waves and corresponding wavelets.

These are like strong and nuclear force derivatives. Furthermore, waves are always hot and wavelets are always cold. Thus, it's typically wavelets that produce cold fusion.

These patterns can be described as lightening in 2D, or "scars".

In fact, if there is time-traveling, it leaves large 6D scars.

In terms of the "maze/tower" of the universe, and "music of the mind", the waves are chasing, while the wavelets are being chased. Or, the waves are like branches, and the wavelets are like twigs.

This pattern could exist as just red/blue from a star, or with a third force (ex: red/blue/green).
