## After 3.14159265

After creating a "star" with a basic two-pole magnetic field, π creates branches around the circle. This looks like the sea-urchin thorns of a blackhole. 

On earth, this is most the roots of a tree. The trunk is 3.141592, the base/crown are 65, and then the roots/branches act like the next 100 numbers.

The roots describe the rules of the system, while the branches describe the outcomes. 

So the first 100 digits (≈3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679) create a system of not just time but also basic history.

Bc every single action corresponds to a specific rule of the star, all outcomes of time can be tracked mathematically.

Red/blue/green of our sun used the rules of trees to create the rules for first flowers and then more advanced biological life.

Around The Hydra, which best captures the 8D ring of 3.14, you can observe these branches of our cosmos, which explain the ways time is essentially tracked everywhere. 

Furthermore, in our own eyes there are branches which explain how we personally create our own time. Very far down the number, you start to see differences, which then change our experiences a lot as people. The biggest difference between people is just how many rules you create, and thus how far down π you exist.

In fact, after 3.14159265, π is really just branches which experiment with combinations to create different colors, experiences, and "ways of seeing".
