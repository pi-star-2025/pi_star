## Square Root of 7

Pi (Ï€) after the light array described by 3.141592 (e^3 hyperplane), describes as efficiently as possible how to create diagonals correlating to square roots of prime numbers.

The square root of 2 creates the circular intelligence for day/night.

The square root of 3 creates the intelligence for waves/weather, from a 1/root-3/2 triangle. This is bc from day/night, day will branch off in one way and this will get mirrored by the night.

The square root of 5 creates the intelligence for a 3-force way of seeing, from a 1/2/root-5 triangle. This is represented by 3.1415926535, indicating that the force of 5 (green) has wrapped around the day/night branches. In other words to stay in sync with day/night and the weather (root-2 and root-3 vision), the root-5 vision will have "anticipated" what the root-2 and root-3 vision was going to do and looked for this result.

This is by finding a compact way to do what the root-2 and root-3 vision is doing. On a mathematical level, the root-2 vision knows how to differentiate between light/dark, the simplest vision. The root-3 vision does what the root-2 vision does, and also looks in particular for light blue vs dark blue. The plant mind via root-5 vision does what the root-3 vision is doing, and then to create a red/blue/green "way of seeing" (and photosynthesis) also looks for light blue that "shines" or is "golden.

This root 2/3/5 way of seeing creates a rainbow with 3.1415926535.

Root 7, with 3.14159265358979, does the same thing as root 5, but also looks to put pressure on one thing it is "seeing" in the system. For example, a carbon crystal growing with 3.14159265358979 intelligence might be emphasizing "one person" the star is putting a lot of pressure on. Or a large tree branch growing from 3.14159265358979 could indicate one core issue from the last 100 years.

By seeing in terms of "pressure", especially with more and more branches (larger and larger prime numbers), life starts to wake up.
