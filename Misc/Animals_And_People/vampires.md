## Vampires

Vampires used to exist. They would die awake, but have such a thirst for blood they would stay alive.

Dying awake means that your heart is completely "cold", meaning it is completely magnetic. It is red/blue/green magnetics, without any red/blue biology. 

Back in the day, in colder environments, with different living conditions, sometimes you could die awake at a young age and exist in a much higher state in the mind of god. 

Often, this can lead to you staying permanently in that magical dream realm. However, there was a tendency for vampires to exist more still in the lower conscious world, bc the feeling of sucking blood and other physical acts can be more "fresh" and exciting in the darker world.

It's also said that vampires were the ones who had a natural tendency to train wolves. Wolves think a lot like the cold-hearted vampires.
