## Horses

Horses are seen as maybe not the brightest animal. They are smarter than expected.

It’s said on average they can be the most unhappy farm animal, bc they have less ability to “speak” and ask for help.

Other animals can just be unhappy, complaining in their minds, and their bodies will fill them with a lot of chemicals to have the experience blend in with the earth mind.

Horses have so much testosterone that their faces and bodies look highly masculinized. In addition, the testosterone always encourages them to embrace challenge and work hard, measured by the amount of time/heat accumulated.

In Atlantis, the comparable animal was dragons.

Around horses, you can feel the heat of their soul, which is similar to lions and tigers. But they don’t take out their masculine energy with eating and hunting, which means they dedicate it to working and patience. Running is not as fun as hunting. As a result, if you were a horse in a past life you become noble and disciplined, like a knight.
