## Peach 

A peach is a fruit that is rotund, in that it is circular but fatter bc it has a low height

Peaches are “cute”, bc they are solving less problems, according to the multiverse. Compared to a fruit that is taller, like an apple.

This is bc shorter/fatter fruits/vegetables that are cute are more what happens when the sun plays with itself, or creates life with more sun power, in exchange for less intelligence by other stars.
