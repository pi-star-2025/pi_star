## Acorns

Each tree/plant can create flowers, leaves, and fruits which are like gadgets describing some idea.

For example, flowers describe a way of seeing by a star, like butterfly wings.

Bananas describe the end of Ï€ as yellow and circular.

Acorns are seeds, which also represent "alarms". They reveal how trees that make acorns organize ideas about "alarms", i.e. the clockwork of time.

Alarms are shaped like acorns. The stem is like a pipe of energy from the star. The cupsule is like the hard crown of clouds, and the nut is like the iron metal earth which is ringing and ringing with "alarm" to generate red/blue/green time.

So by keeping a cap/crown firmly stuck on the earth, you get the center of the earth to rattle and shake. We know this is done by the starlight of acorn trees (via the green atmosphere), bc they also understand how to use this architecture pattern to protect their seeds and start life.
