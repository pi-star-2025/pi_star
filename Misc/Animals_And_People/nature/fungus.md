## Fungus

The earth mind started waking up when electrons via plants began to choose more and more whether they were the day or night. 

It’s like choosing between different sides of 18:32:18 via gold, or the day/night of the planet (via 3.14159265).

If the electrons really show a preference for left or right (day/night), it’s a sign the system has more intelligence. This is first manifested in plants, when the more “masculine” electrons clearly favored the the underworld of fungal networks, bc of the ways these plants could think versus flowers. 

Grass was typically more feminine, while trees was more masculine. However, this was much much more pronounced in fungus vs flowers. It even led to the very very first life being flower and mushrooms souls. 
The flowers were highly feminized; the mushrooms were highly masculinized. 

Also flowers/mushrooms are a way to connect with hyper feminine or hyper masculine spirits around the multiverse. The flowers “sing”, whereas the mushrooms “think”.

…

Furthermore the day/night of the Plant Mind (the green mind) is the fungal networks at night, and the flower beds, especially in dense forests during the day.

Birds, insects, and other animals join this network during the day.

Truly nocturnal animals connect to the network during the night, like bats, wolves, rats, and lions.

Humans have never been truly nocturnal, but humans who have been these nocturnal animals as smaller souls have a “better sense of directions” and are generally better at magic.

Through a network of quadrillions of equal and opposite reactions, electrons that favored "light" tended to wind up in human females, and electrons that favored "dark" tended to wind up in human males.

Jesus is known for trying to lead everyone to "the light". And Mozart (once the antichrist) highlighted how this can create confining gender roles.
