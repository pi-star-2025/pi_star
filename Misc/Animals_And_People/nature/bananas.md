## Bananas

In our universe of red/blue/green, we don’t really create true gold as a color. Instead we create yellow, according to the multiverse.

Yellow is simpler and slower than gold, but can be used to help understand gold better.

We can tell the difference between yellow and gold mostly by looking at the colors and sensing the difference.

Yellow is one way to represent the end of π. For example, this was done by The Devil in the land of angels. He wore a yellow costume like a comic book hero, and he is sometimes called “The Banana Man”.

Yellow also “tastes” like bananas, and could be called the taste of simplicity or satisfaction. It’s the confession that a multiverse where we see yellow as acceptable and not “gross” is preferred, even if it makes the world corny. It means a world of red/blue/green telling a story about gold with yellow is useful.

Ancient seers of this universe would simulate to the end and see the “color” yellow integrated, which told them a lot more than historical/societal facts, bc their ancient universes were so different. The first level on top of math (vision) makes the most sense.

Bananas, through natural selection of starlight, encoded a genetic trick to always share starlight/sunlight with banana trees on the exact opposite end of the earth. The natural selection was not random. It was due to a fight in the red/blue/green atmosphere to create the most powerful court of souls/magic. The core earth (Mother Earth) used thick trees in Africa and the Middle East (ex: Baobab trees) to create a dominant force. The Devil’s Court was created with Banana Trees, which used the ancient alien’s super understanding of π to wrap around the full earth, and in doing so created fruits that had a “simulated solution” to the end of π.

In the kingdom of angels at one point, this dark and cartoonish Devil's Court lurked around the central Tower. It was not necessarily seen as good/bad yet, until Year 300BC - Year 0. 

Nevertheless, bananas are a great way to understand the deep intelligence of Mother Earth. It helps us understand that if we took the "gold" from above and crushed it into physical existence, pulling from both ends of the earth, it could turn into the pulp/peel of bananas.
