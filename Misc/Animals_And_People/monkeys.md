## Consciousness 

Consciousness can be just having a conversation in the mind that never ends 

The human skull is complex enough to do that 

The mind does this by continuously finding ways to make you smile 

Since monkeys were the animals smiling and laughing the most, they were picked to become standing and conscious 

Smiling is when you use the third eye to make new quantum 8-5-3 time fall into your mind

Humans are conscious bc the mind is constantly in some small way, at least, finding a way to make us smile

## Earth Smile

For earth the smile is the 3.14159265 magnetic crown of the sun

This crown/smile makes the sun's vision more intense during the day, and less intense at night 

This is also how the starlight falls into being the mind of the earth
