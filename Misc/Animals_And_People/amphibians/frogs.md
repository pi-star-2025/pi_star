## Frogs

You might never guess it, but frogs feel in a way like they are always sleeping.

Perhaps you could tell by the way their eyes are rolled back.

They don't act asleep, jumping high and twitching fast, but in some way they are.

When you are asleep, the throat has more muscular actions because you are not speaking. In humans this leads to snoring; in frogs this leads to tongue strength.

Frogs use their big eyes for both hearing/seeing.

## Green Seer

While frogs are hearing, sometimes the swamp using many frogs is "seeing". For example, the air of lily pads and willow trees can swirl together above the swamp, using frogs and insects for vision.

The belly-button of humans can also be used for hearing/seeing. The hearing is by people, and the seeing is by the "earth". When the earth is seeing through you that is a state of nirvana, or dreaming awake.
