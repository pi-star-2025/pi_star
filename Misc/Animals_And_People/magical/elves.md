## Elves

What people think of you each moment 

Like the way you track the social hierarchy is based on your back ears 

The back ears take in air that is like hearing behind the scenes (hearing people’s emotions) 

Then your spine is used to go up or down based on recorded intelligence in the spine balls. Going up means happy. Going down means un popular.

Some people don’t care much about back ears (small ears) as a way of perceiving the world, and then care less what others think of them 

Elves can be very intelligent with these small ears and thus can be very musical and socially adept 

Elves no longer exist. They were clans of people that merged with others.

They also could often do magic that involved “in the dark” communication like even trances to protect their communities
