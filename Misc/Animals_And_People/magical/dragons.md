## Dragon Eggs 

When starting the universe, our core goddess (3.1415) made a bet that a way to reconcile the 3.14159265 pressure of red/blue/gold is going to be to see this pressure as being an “egg” of what is inside. 

For example, in Atlantis, dragons would protect their children inside of eggs, especially if they were golden eggs (bc of 3.14159265 instinct) but sometimes still eat their children. This then changed for domesticated dragons. Domesticated dragons resembled dinosaurs, who were cartoonish bc they were red/blue/green (not red/blue/gold), and used iron for the 65. The eggs were not as precious on red/blue/green earth, but the dinosaurs were not as aggressive as dragons.

The trees use a red/blue/green ozone to see the earth as an egg. It creates extreme pressure, but can still be flipped into “Mother Earth” (seeing the earth as egg to protect). This creates a starter-spirit for the more intelligent plant life, which extends the mind of the sun. The sun (and all stars) also see planets in their 3.14159265 rotations as “eggs”. 

Lastly, the entire 3.1415 triangle sees galaxies as “eggs”. This connects extreme pressure with a purpose, which gives it multiverse “shine” to exist, bc it is possible that seeing 3.14159265 as an egg is a way to enhance and clarify the force of “gold”. The multiverse doesn't know why; it just knows it's possible.

So, this is one trademark added by our red/blue/green time and the original goddess (3.1415). We proved how 3.14159265 if “seen” by the original triangle as always an “egg” has the potential to create living gold.
