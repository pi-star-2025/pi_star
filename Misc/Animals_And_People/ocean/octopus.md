## Octopus 

The octopus is an underwater spider. It will use the soul of a squid that acts like a dreamer, to create a 2-souled creature.

The octopus is seen as feminine (queen); the squid is seen as masculine (worker). The octopus gains power in life, whereas the squid will lose some power.

Sometimes, these souls can continue and then know based on being an octopus/squid, whether they want to be a human male or female.

Octopi are considered smarter than spiders bc of sharing time live, versus postmortem.

The pairings between octopi and squids happen bc the octopi are looking to trap vision and the squids are constantly ejecting theirs.
