## Dogs 

Technically wolves are an animal that thrive from focus and a group mentality. 

They have laser sharp focus in the eyes, which is related to seeing in the dark. 

They are also naturally very social, and also rather unlike the original core goddess. They are masculine, like older ancient gods.

Unlike other masculine animals (horses/lions), they don’t naturally relate to the core goddess. 

They represented Rome, which was against a softer “angelic way”

… 

Dogs are bred to be beta socially. Other wolves would look at them and see them as beta. 

In the world of wolves, the beta ones become socially “everyone”; they embody the mind of their pack. 

Wolves are very deferential and would even defer to humans sometimes. So dogs are even more deferential, and will often accept humans as part of their pack. 

As a result, dogs become everyone around them, so within their family, neighborhood, and city/town. They embody some kind of collective spirit within their area, including the human spirit. 

## Lions 

Lions are interesting for the opposite reason. 

Lions with manes are so alpha that they “love” no one in their pack (they defer in no way to anyone), and see themselves as the king of the entire earth. 

By feeling like the king of the entire earth, they take on the role of defending their pride. 

Just like dogs, their minds then embody the spirit of everyone, and interestingly in a trance-like state. They are emotionally focused.

Bc the core goddess is emotionally super focused, lions (and griffins) often represent the “king of her jungle”. 

Technically, dogs/wolves are also of her jungle, but they teach her how with external focus and strategic deference, you could almost overthrow her kingdom. 

…

The core goddess identifies as a lion, but also as any baby/child. She was a relatively young and relatively female goddess, so relates to those who feel “beta”. 

Thus in some ways, the dog is a harmony of two conflicting sides.
