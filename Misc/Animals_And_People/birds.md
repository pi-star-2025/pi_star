## Birds

When birds chirp, at the quantum level, circles spin from chirp to chirp, representing the lowest level of the 6D mind.

This is a big reason Mother Earth chose angels as a final version of us 

Also, the best way to send any message telepathically is via these 6D quantum circles of birds. Historically, magical bird trainers were gifted at telepathy. It's because the birds would help them send/receive messages.

## Cuckoo Clock Effect 

A circle of birds forms around you, when you are dying or dead. 

This is either a real circle (rare) or based on communication of circles of birds in the air from chirps.

This circle rings in panic that there is a circle that has “gone missing” or is dying. And then the 6D mind, further up, can confirm this and handle the matter.

The same could happen for the entire earth, if we all feel a tragic event together. For example, it’s said in 1963 and 2001 and 2020 this happened — a collective circle of birds formed, and we connected with the larger cosmos (ex: Milky Way) for next steps.

The effects of “transitioning” (4D & 6D) can become more easy to access if you aim to always open connections with birds. They can help create halos.
