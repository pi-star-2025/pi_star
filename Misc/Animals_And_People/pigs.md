## When Pigs Fly

Reptiles are happiest we find when they have full control of their hypothalamus. Mammals are happiest when they have full control of their breath, especially from the power in the front of the nose.

As a result of the power from their sense of smell, pigs have a real connection to their stomach, in particular their belly buttons.

Pigs don't have great "vision" the way we think, but via emotions can really see the future well. They know what it will be feel like to be a happy mammal.
