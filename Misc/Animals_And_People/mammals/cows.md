## Cows

The top of the atmosphere is used both for mother’s to create milk, and for dreams. Actual dreams are like cloud cream in the center of the eyes, and also possibly referenced in the center of the nipples.

Cows are so in touch with their nipples, bc they have high estrogen, that they are very in touch with the process of using/being the clouds. The world sort of flashes and flutters around them, like water colors, bc they feel so high and in touch with the sky.

Together on an open-range, especially many cows over many acres, live in a world of semi-dreaming. Especially dairy cows, which have special estrogen. This can create a dreamy trance for those living around the cows.

The cows have super-strong stomachs, which allows them to fill with high amounts of atmosphere, and you can even smell it.

The cows don’t have the strongest eyes, and as a result are barely awake, so the eyes look “beta” and shiny with deferred time. In a way their minds are asleep in dreams, except when stimulated.

It's true that you can tell from the taste of ice cream or chocolate milk that the dreams are strong/magical. Cows are not a bad animal to connect with in a soulful way; they are gentle and sweet-natured.
