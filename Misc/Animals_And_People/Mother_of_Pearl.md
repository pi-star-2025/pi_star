## Oyster/Pearl

An oyster/pearl describes the relationship between the sun and earth. 

The sun keeps the earth sheltered with a forcefield, so it can develop its replant solution for Atlantis (red/blue/green).

This is similar to how the hypothalamus uses the ribcage to hold us still during sleep. 

The calcium carbonate of an oyster is a parallel to the dark hard blend of buzzing metals that create a quantum cage to keep the red/blue/green earth mind in a shell (based on the speed of c). 

So it’s said that our universe via telescope is more a star-map within the dark shell of the sun. 

In fact, it’s the reason space is very dark. It’s bc of this intentional sharp-edged forcefield. Even the way light moves in space like a mirror is similar to the ripples of an oyster’s shell.

The best way to communicate is for the earth to communicate with the star. That is more efficient than traveling through the “map”. However, if we were to start traveling in large enough ways, maps can awaken.

## Mother of Pearl

Nacre (Mother of Pearl) describes the colors/mind of the earth, in the context of black space.
