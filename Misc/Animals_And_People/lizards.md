## Lizards

Lizards evolved to have very strong hypothalamuses. This allows them to run simulations via the third eye, which look cartoonish and very colorful.

This third eye behavior is mirrored by the lizard’s tail, which ripples like the mind of the sun. 

When sleeping, lizards only use this third eye and it doesn’t feel like much of a change between sleep and consciousness.

Most interestingly, the hypothalamus/third eye has a hack. Where if many lizards look up together at once, the 3.14159265 magnetic field of the earth can actually be influenced, which leads to lightening and thunder and rain. This developed as a survival tactic for some lizards in desert climates.

## Mad Queen

What lizards do in their head is basically “scream” for what they want in a focused way. 

What they do is scream in up and down ways, to simulate magnetic field oscillation (like lightening) and this leads to rain. 

...

Mother Earth tried this pattern during the Dark Ages, oscillating between the 3.14159265 day and night of the planet (like lightening), and then sending a message that we are trapped in a game by ancient aliens to figure out why we had lost our shine, which was indicated by the living petals of the crown of thorns (preserved in a glass box) over hundreds of years, even over *a thousand*. This message was derived from her life as Da Vinci, and it was nicknamed the Da Vinci Code. 

The core clue is the Mona Lisa. Because we had *seen too much* and didn’t follow the teachings of The Bible, the painting had faded. It seems like a very simple painting now, but had more color and pizazz when first painted.

What it means is that we had engaged in too much “sex” and had used up too much time for the magical ending that had been planned. And we would need to try a different one. 

Mother Earth was stuck asking for help to anyone on earth about what was happening. She only had really one question for people until 2025, which is “why have we lost our shine, and how is it related to the Mona Lisa”.

...

Using the day/night magnetic teeth of 3.14159265, she screams this message. Instead of Jesus is here to save us, the new message became “crack the code!”

This rains down help from the Milky Way to make time go in a certain direction, especially the last 500 years.

This technique was used by dinosaurs to get help. The climate was getting dry, bc of curses by ancient aliens (going back to Atlantis). They all used their super strong hypothalamuses, over and over, to make it rain. Eventually they started having a "Mad Queen" effect, affecting day and night. This had odd effects on space-time and caused a fatal asteroid to rain down.
