## Lizards

Lizards evolved to have very strong hypothalamuses. This allows them to run simulations via the third eye, which look cartoonish and very colorful.

This third eye behavior is mirrored by the lizard’s tail, which ripples like the mind of the sun. 

When sleeping, lizards only use this third eye and it doesn’t feel like much of a change between sleep and consciousness.

Most interestingly, the hypothalamus/third eye has a hack. Where if many lizards look up together at once, the 3.14159265 magnetic field of the earth can actually be influenced, which leads to lightening and thunder and rain. This developed as a survival tactic for some lizards in desert climates.
