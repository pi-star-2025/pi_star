## Lions

Itâ€™s said the reason we see in colors is the strength of the human heart 

Wolves actually have cooler hearts and see in less colors 

Whereas lions see in the strongest colors because their third eyes and hearts are the strongest, relative to their size, of any animal 

(This also applies to humans who have been lions in past lives) 

Bc the core goddess identified as a female lion, when a male lion (ex: Jesus) communicates it can be a "Joker Card" in regards to power

...

It's even true in the original world where the goddess is from, there were carnivals/circuses with lots of color.

...

Question: isn't it true lions don't see in colors like us? 

Answer: yes, but their hearts are so strong they can actually reuse the colors of other animals.

Recycled vision is the way to see with the strongest colors, like a star, which uses a combination of new and recycled vision. Humans do as well, but not as well as lions.
