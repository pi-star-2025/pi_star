## Quantum Gravity

It’s known by the red/blue/green quantum plant mind (fungal mind) that you can create raw power by nesting circles. Like trees. But then you crystallize, like the wood of a tree, or even an emerald crystal, bc you perfectly commit to some quantum message. You turn into a quantum radio. So interestingly, all trees and some precious stones have turned into quantum radios, by nesting circles.

By “crystallize” it means you die. Trees are not *really* alive; their intelligence is in the clouds. Butterflies actually die, living in the clouds while in cocoons (which have crystallized), and then come back to life, in angelic states.

## Patterns

A caterpillar in a cocoon is frozen, like a cloud or a galaxy.

Clouds are frozen bc of so many deferred-seeing decisions that space-time turns into weather (like water/ice) and allows the stars to watch the object within space/time more slowly. So clouds allow stars to watch the earth, and evidence is the patterns of flowers, the sea, and mountains. And cocoons actually allow the sun, and another star, to watch a caterpillar and sort of give it a "heavenly" character.

The eyes are very similar to cocoons/clouds. This "cocoon effect" within the skull is so strong, and that is the primary reason we feel advanced intelligence.
