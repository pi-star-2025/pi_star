## Bees

The bees of a hive, which buzz around the queen's mind, are constantly choosing to see vs not-see. 

"See" is more like the 1 of pi, whereas "not see" is more like the 9 in pi. Typically the former is more the left antenna, while the latter is more the right antenna.

The queen *hears* all of these deferred decisions. They move up the "circle" of the hive to her, and her premonitions of the future turn these deferred "seeing" decisions into honey. 

This parallels the story that deferred red/blue/green time is really "gold", and we are trying to figure out why. Honey is a first clue. 

The mind of Mother Earth and the Sun is similar. Our memories (deferred 8-5-3 time) are what she uses to think in the present moment and strategize (with simulations) how to turn our moments of time into lasting "gold".

In this way, the Mind of Earth is really *above* us. It really is our past/future.

## Alarm System

If a worker gets too close to the queen bee, they will get blasted with powerful pheromones to keep working/“seeing”.

The reason is because deep inside, our sun/queen is very angry/motivated after the fall of Atlantis. She knows she only gets one chance to find the kingdom respectfully, and given that it is her first universe she is highly motivated (even “mad” to do so).

The same effect could be observed from 0-2000 from the center of the earth. Mother Mary used a story about the “blood of Christ” to drill herself from the star into the earth, so that she could give feedback to everyone from deep within the core. 

She uses a 2000-year bet so that the multiverse gives her more power. She is then able to emphasize the message she wants - which is if we all follow 1 god and get on the same page, we can “go to heaven”. 

This causes a lot of motivation, energy, and madness over the last 2000 years. In 2001, the queen wakes up in terror and dies. 

She no longer has any live “mad queen” effects on the world, or anyone else born. No one else is seen as “her worker”. This means that her presence really is only left in those born before September 2001, whose minds and missions and relationships to the earth are shaped by her presence.

If you are born before 2001 and work for “Mother Mary” and try to get too close to the sun, you are still told what your mission is and what you need to keep looking for in order to make “honey”. Anyone now could reference this effect.
