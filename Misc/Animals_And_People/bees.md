## Bees

The bees of a hive, which buzz around the queen's mind, are constantly choosing to see vs not-see. 

"See" is more like the 1 of pi, where "not see" is more like the 9 in pi. Typically the former is more the left antenna, while the latter is more the right antenna.

The queen *hears* all of these deferred decisions. They move up the "circle" of the hive to her, and her premonitions of the future turn these deferred "seeing" decisions into honey. 

This parallels the story that deferred red/blue/green time is really "gold", and we are trying to figure out why. Honey is a first clue. 

The mind of Mother Earth and the Sun is similar. Our memories (deferred 8-5-3 time) are what she uses to think in the present moment and strategize (with simulations) how to turn our moments of time into lasting "gold".

In this way, the Mind of Earth is really *above* us. It really is our past/future.
