## Pain

Pleasure derives from vision and seeing 

In particular merging with nested vision is the simplest definition of pleasure 

Pain is derived from anti seeing 

From some decision not to see

When this is very strong the effect is like a forcefield 

In particular suns can create forcefields to keep the rotation of planets and moons in place. So there is then cosmic pain if there is a quantum glitch, enforced via solar winds 

In a similar fashion if our bodies think we are out of certain rotations 

They will create forcefields (pain) to try to stabilize our bodies

Nested forcefields and refined taste in vision are what escalate pain 

â€¦

The best way to alleviate pain is to control our hearts which most can act as a forcefield in the body (and reference the strongest solar winds)

..

Another way to put it...

Pain is a cross of stars

Created by the forcefields of all stars collectively (in 3-body problems)

These 3-body problems criss-crossed create the box of time.
