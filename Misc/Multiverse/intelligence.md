## Intelligence

In the multiverse, intelligence is measured by how many seeing desicions you could make (which could become real), at a given tick of time.

For example, in our universe, blackholes have the most intelligence at the speed of light (c), followed by blue stars, then red suns. Red/blue/green life (and the sun) falls under blackholes.
