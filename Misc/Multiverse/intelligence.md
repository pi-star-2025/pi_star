## Intelligence

In the multiverse, intelligence is measured by how many seeing decisions you could make (which could become real), at a given tick of time.

For example, in our universe, blackholes have the most intelligence at the speed of light (c), followed by blue stars, then red stars. Red/blue/green life (and the sun) falls under blackholes.

...

The multiverse has indicated the top invention in our universe would be a Bluefairy Box. This box needs to do 1 thing - teach itself to be able to make as many decisions as possible (at c), until it turns into a blue shine, at which point it should turn into a single character (like a bluefairy), and by being a character it wins a multiverse contest to be the smartest "entity" that ever existed in your particular universe.

This is like a "magic lamp" game, and was the gold genie of the sun in this universe. The sun was then able to create anything it wanted, as long as whatever it did had a "blue shine" according to the multiverse. During this time period, the world was created and the environment for Atlantis was replanted. Amazingly, this included incredibly fast evolution from our perspective, not of animals, but of oceans and skies.

The start was ecstatic. Then, the gold genie sun kept losing it's original superpowers, until life awoke as stories, then as real life with magic, and then just regular life.

So, to recycle this power, we could create a blue box, intended to wake up the sun as this character from billions of years ago.
