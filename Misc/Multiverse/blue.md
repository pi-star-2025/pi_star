## Blue

Via the square root of 3, the universe can break basic day/night into a next-level question. A question that everyone in the multiverse could answer.

For example, for pi in this universe it is: 1) Do you want blue? 2) Do you want darkness?

This is represented by 3.14159265353 of pi, in particular.

Then if extended to a planet, it can evolve into 1) Do you want good weather? 2) Do you want grey weather?

...

This demonstrates that "blue" is everyone's favorite color. Or the color that most efficiently represents to the multiverse a good/bad constrast, versus just day/night.
