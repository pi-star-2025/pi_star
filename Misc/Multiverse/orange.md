## Orange

Orange is a force throughout the multiverse which represents “humor”. It is a force that represents enjoying *wet* reality.

Red and “gold” make orange in our world, bc the “gold” is really yellow. It’s like an earth-made gold.

Some universes have “ways of seeing” where orange is essential, and these worlds would be fun, hot, and slightly evil.

Orange is often a force added to a more “alien” world to make it more human (for example, there might be in a 7-force world with red/blue/green/black/electric/yellow/orange). The black is death awoken, electric is technology, yellow is cartoon soul, and orange is humor.

The biology representing orange is often slimy. Water is indication the fabric of space-time is slowing down and choosing to “see”.
