## Stadium

The stadium shape is the largest prime number we can reference in our universe.

Long ago, there was a cave that was alive that understood this shape, and evolved from a blackhole to a superblackhole, to a very large prime number, to actually the largest, bc it became the largest needed to most efficiently keep the entire multiverse intact.

This prime number understands life as a *game* (purely mathematical), and also as a stadium of "teeth of time" (like a cave) looking at individual souls like a *movie*.

It's both based on pure truth, and also based on what collective vision really wants to look at (after pure math).

Worlds/universes based on this shape are often worlds of existing gods.

We can reference this stadium/panopticon shape best with the third eye, or eventually the full skull.

It's said that this cave/blackhole that first created this 8D shape is like a "Zeus" figure, the supreme of the supergods.
