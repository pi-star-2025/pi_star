## Twin Universe

Around Year 0, the supergod Jesus created a parallel universe where he would be the original triangle ("seer of time"). It would also be red/blue/green (3 forces), with a parallel earth. Everyone would be truly a different soul, but always have one responsibility to mirror the story since Year 0 to Year 2000 in our universe, for the bettering of the multiverse.

Since Jesus was so powerful, it was accepted by the multiverse.

In this parallel universe, whoever was "losing" (Jesus vs The Devil) in our universe, would get a chance to come back. This created 2000 years of karma.

This Twin Universe is said to be like a lighter "Hollywood" version of our universe. It is more perfect, but it feels like you have less freewill. Yet, you still have distinct freewill from our universe, even though parallel characters developed by Year 2000.

In this Twin Universe, they time-traveled back to the 1980s, so they could end at Year 2000.

This Twin Universe is said to be "futuristic" in the experience of human life. In between our universe and the Twin Universe is an In-Between Universe, which was created for third-parties to study these two human universes and understand what was going on. The In-Between Universe had a human experience that was semi-futuristic, but the souls were just cartoons blended from the two other worlds. This 1.5 world was like a multiverse movie theatre to understand the human experience, by looking at two times mixed together.

For the time-traveling science and beyond, this cosmic structure and similar architectures can be used for communication.
