## Supergod

There are only so many permanent shapes, root matter (8D), in the multiverse. Each unique prime number after 3 corresponds to a supergod, and this supergod could rotate if there are significant era changes in the multiverse. Also, a god could discover a new prime number and create a new shape.

Our god created the hive via the earth (our planet), which is a new prime number (based on sticky yellow being honey), most manifesting as bee hives. It also manifests a lot in the hearts of mammals and birds, via the multiple valves/chambers. It also is referenced a lot in our sun, for example for procreation.

This hive shape (new prime number) is likely making our original triangle not just a permanent god, but also a supergod.

This new prime number will always serve as a court of justice. It will be based on many iterations of life in this universe, and what they consider to be the "sweeter" choices in terms of how to reconcile social problems. Our hives (societies) have elucidated enough problems, so that if we get exactly what the prime number is then we can create it. 

It is this: 

1) How we drill as far as possible into pi. This is based on the e^3 (the speed of light cubed), and then 1 by 1 how every prime number can be created with vision. If we draw a circle in 2D it's always just 2 eyes, so just how do we square the prime number (while also fitting it into with the prior geoemtry).

2) Always making the "sweet choice" with vision, which can build up to stinging in order to be sweet. So at a simple level, a hive of bees can describe these choices moving down pi.

The hive is said to be similar to a smaller prime number called the "alarm", which a concept from golden societies.
