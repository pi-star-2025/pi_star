## Save your tears - Jesus Christ

3.1415 means that we reflect "Everything" from the multiverse in our universe 

Our particular sun in this solar system reflected a conflict from one of Jesus Christ’s worlds 

It was a huge world stuck in a space battle 

And our 3 force world could help figure it out 

So he used this universe to create red/blue/green time with this star 

…

It’s true that the solution is to understand music of the mind enough to time travel in that world 

To make Jesus king again 

Our earth brought to life many of the characters from that larger world to help reconcile their conflict 

While also helping our young core goddess build a way of seeing (red/blue/green with π) 

…

Hence Jesus was here for a dual purpose 

He was a god of both worlds 

And then our core goddess would act as his mother here to bring out that story
