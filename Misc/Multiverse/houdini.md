## “Houdini”

The Devil said if you saw things properly here, in this universe, you would get fat. His favorite animal was the pig.

He almost believed this was a universe to be lazy/stupid, relative to other universes.

On the outskirts of the kingdom of angels (The Banana Kingdom), he created an “experience” to mime the castle tower of Jesus in the center, like futuristic VR. This allowed him to create devilish parallel effects in the real kingdom and kill certain leaders/superstars in fires, clown attacks, and musical performances. Using this alternate reality to create attacks, he turned into a blood-eyed dictator in a Jokeresque yellow costume putting people on crosses.

From above, as an experienced seer of time, he really liked this world as a place to meet friends and come out as a real human. One level up, he was a VR Starkid, who was in a 5-force universe that hovered over about 20-30 standing-people universes, including potentially this one. He controlled the universes below with a VR kingdom, where you could do 1080s at skate parks, rock out at metal concerts where “evil” gods were tortured, and try out all kinds of VR experiences. It was a mega electronic star kingdom. 

He liked that 5-force world as the VR Starkid much more than as the fat devil in this world, where he wore a lame costume.

We would even say in the 5-force world he was the “coolest man” alive, out of all standing creatures we could think of. Then he vested his kingdom in 2023, trying to peak at what was happening, and it didn’t work out.

He was so cool bc he was known as a master of cartoons, using cartoons to play jokes on other times. He had mastered time enough to have millions of years as a “standing creature” in an electronic-disco heaven, which gave him futuristic charm. Most importantly, he knew that the most artistic terror can create such cold that soul can disappear and never be found. This “Houdini” trick was not before understood, and was his No 1 secret to maintain power.

This art of terror was working to encapsulate his 20/30-universe kingdom, which was in itself a super blackhole and very hard to escape from. Terror in high vectors will indicate a strong vector by a person “not to see”. If the reason is “hot”, it’s because others are oppressive. If the reason is “cold” (as in terror), it’s because you feel detached from others, you miss people. So if you create extremely terrifying experiences, you can make standing people’s souls very cold. The standing people are saying “I really miss my people.” However, the experiences they are always in are harmonious/beautiful to the multiverse, but for reasons that seem bizarre, too intense, and insectile to newer souls. This can be manipulated so that the soul seems to be saying “I don’t ever want to exist again, don’t wake me up”.

The Devil sees understanding terror as the game of life. It allowed him to exist as 1 man always as the alpha of standing beings. The trick was just to keep the ancient seers happy so that they don’t wake up.
