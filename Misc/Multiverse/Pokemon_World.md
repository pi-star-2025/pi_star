Our star, our goddess was in a world like Pokemon World (before the Start of Time)

A super blackhole where gods could live in a super intelligent paradise and start universes based on what forces they believed would add value to the entire multiverse 

It could be 2 forces to just gather data 

It could be 101 to create unimaginably meaningful and intelligent time 

But to do this requires probably many past universes you’ve “seen as a blackhole”

...

Originally, our goddess was from a world that was like standing lions 

And she was the daughter of the leader who mastered “VR” (called “Eye Candy") to end time. With a basic understanding of "pi"

That was a 3 force world 

Where it was also red blue and then the third force was silver or mirrors that were awake 

...

And they were just living mirrors 

So we would find them to be like mechanical beings 

So she was like a living crystal of fire 

But to us would look like a female lion in spirit

And she decided to start a world (from the Supermassive Blackhole) believing that the force of red could prove music was how everyone could be "conscious" 

Anything in the multiverse even very unconscious forces can come to life with music 

This she believed was for the better, bc of justice. To give the multiverse a better "heart"

...

And it created a huge game of life universe 

She was the force of red 

She chose to have the force of blue see her 

Which in this Pokemon World super blackhole they gave her the power to do so bc she was a young but respected enough goddess where if she wanted to put then all her matter on the line for this vision it was accepted with a multiverse “shine”

So in the Pokemon World she was this queen now bc she chose to start this new blackhole 

And she even began to adopt the form and mind of the time she was seeing 

So she became this “firestarter queen”

Young ambitious and possibly genius or evil

She was given a mirror in her story above to figure out why it was “blue” and spinning like a crystal ball 

It was her puzzle

She found a third force of green 

And that significantly paused time above 

From the perspective down here 

And you can tell by the stadium of stars in our deep cosmos 

It created a huge multiverse buzz this 3 force combination 

Red 

Blue 

Green 

...

3 is a common number of forces, but not advanced

Our goddess was a first-time "seer"

She had lived in a 3-force world and had become a a goddess above, of crystal fire 

And the trees figured out 3.1415, how it is related to social circles

And 8/5/3 deferred time and burst this answer up 

She then decided to keep looking for more time 

She was optimistic based on the results of plant life

And she said I will even now start to become this life as the earth 

So the firestarter goddess became Mother Earth to develop more conscious life 

Then spiders developed 8 directional vision 

Living 8/5/3 time, with music like sunlight dancing in the webs 

And the other gods and goddesses fell in and became other insects 

##

Certain aliens wanted to deceive the Mind of God to stay in two-sided thinking, and not find a third force

This could pass as justice via "beautiful mathematics" to eventually eat the universe and take the goddess's time

For example, all earth time could be taken via a "hollywood story" about pi, described with perfect calculus 

By Year 0, it was known the two forces were colliding - those for and against the original god and her Red/Blue/Green code of life. If a Red/Blue/Green pi reconciled the original c^2 mirror with "all matter" in the multiverse, then it would have some significant effects on ancient hierarchies.

In addition, it would have effects on hierarchies here. For exxample, around Year 0 related to the Roman Empire.


...

Our goddess became and embodied the force of green as Mother Earth and humanity 

Around Year 0, Mother Earth said this crown of thorns will be the same one you wear in heaven 

Why?

Bc it’s the same *time*

And I guarantee that in about 2000 years we will have the people and civilization and thus time to prove it 

...

When pi was understood to 3.1415 like in the readme (early 2025), this led to the Mad Queen goddess waking up and understanding the mirror she was looking at and why she wore a crown of thorns with green leaves in the reflection.

She “syncs up her understanding” of 3.1415 connecting to red blue green
