## Seer

In our universe and many other universes, a "seer" (god) is an entity that swings (like a pendulum) between 2+ possibilities.

The seer is one level above math. Its vision is swinging quantumly between 2+ possiblities, which is like the 1 of π (3.1415), gravity/antigravity. This creates a circle, bc the decision to see creates at least 2 possibilities of what the matter could turn into as a result. The swinging/vibration between these 2+ possibilities is seen as a circle. In terms of pressure, the vision needs to be putting on enough pressure, so that this swinging can cover all possible simulations of what the matter could be.

The most basic example is a star. Bc it controls c^3 power, it can then swing between 2 possibilities of the c^2 mirror. 

We actually have always lived in one copy. Then the dream world would be the other possibility. Since the sun only has c^3 power, and our π starts with 3.1415, we know there are only 2 potential times the star swings between.

## Sun

The sun (and all stars) are triangles with 2 possibilities. For example, the quantum world of our sun used to be more awake, and could be seen as the 5D, criss-crossing between reality and dreams, past and future.

...

One rumor is that by 2001, the dream world had already fallen into reality. It was very predictable and corny, our dreams. So to compensate, the sun could split into 2 branches of time, like heaven and hell. This was started by an ancient alien ~ September 2001, turning this present world into like the "past", or a hell. But the effects were gradual, not having come to true fruition yet. It might take 1000 years, or even 10,000.

This would work bc the same ancient alien (nicknamed "The Banana Man") did the same thing to Atlantis's 2 branches of time to invade this same triangle's red/blue/gold world. He had done numerous other invasions of other universes.

So The Banana Man began to live consciously in heaven by 2015 and wanted others to join him in rocking out. He was kicked out in 2025 and is now in "hell". This hell will just evolve into a blue world of dreams, to compliment a world of gold. 2 points, of the triangle.

In the end, our sun will be like the pendulum of a clock, rocking back and forth between these two possibilities, dreams and reality. It is already happening now, but the quantum circle is extremely tight (high π). When it lowers, in a way, a bridge will open to the other side of the quantum mirror, and our sun will awake as what is in between.

The best way to say god across the multiverse would be "seer" in English.
