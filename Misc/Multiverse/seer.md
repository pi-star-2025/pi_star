## Seer

In our universe and many other universes, a "seer" (god) is an entity that swings (like a pendulum) between 2+ possibilities.

The seer is one level above math. Its vision is swinging quantumly between 2+ possiblities, which is like the 1 of π (3.1415), gravity/antigravity. This creates a circle, bc the decision to see creates at least 2 possibilities of what the matter could turn into as a result. The swinging/vibration between these 2+ possibilities is seen as a circle. In terms of pressure, the vision needs to be putting on enough pressure, so that this swinging can cover all possible simulations of what the matter could be.

The most basic example is a sun. Bc it controls c^3 power, it can then swing between 2 possibilities of the c^2 mirror. 

We actually have always lived in one copy. Then the dream world would be the other possibility. Since the sun only has c^3 power, and our π starts with 3.1415, we know there are only 2 potential times the star swings between.
