## Yin and Yang

In the multiverse, after math there is yin and yang 

Yin is vision and what chooses to be smaller persistently

Everything else is yang which is seen 

In our universe electrons are more yin and a nucleus is more yang

So in Ï€, the 1 (of 3.1415) is like yin and the rest of the shapes are like yang

...

There are two core kinds of Yin: quantum and non-quantum.

From our perspective, quantum is gas (circular) and non-quantum is magnetic (non-circular).

Magnetics are perfectly non-circular when they are a shine created from shapes and have no quantum conflicts to figure out.

In our universe, "wind" from gases indicate falling into life to figure out conflicts. Magnetics are perfectly mathematical, so don't have any wind.

At the end of time, everything will be more magnetic (as opposed to gassy), representing cooler solutions.
