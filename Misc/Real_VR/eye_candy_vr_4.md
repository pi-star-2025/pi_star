## Eye Candy

From the perspective of the 6D mind, the sphere of the earth creates a globe of water and ice, instead of hard blue space. So the 4 of 3.14 of the original triangle is not perceived as hard blue space, but is slowed down into blue ice/water.

From our perspective this ice/water is the coldest thing possible, but to the 6D/8D mind (original triangle and star light) it is like "eye candy", the most enjoyable, bc it is the slowest time. Every thing on earth can be seen very clearly, and with the powerful vision of stars/gods.
