## Sun Pipe

Each tick of time, there is a pipe of light from the star in the sky to the two eyes. If you were to die, you would most likely take a straight line path of your past/present/future up this pipe to the star. 

Some have very defined second-star connections (ex: if they have a longer story through time), which can cause more right-brain activity from these 3-body problems. 

The heart has a pipe to mimick this sun pipe, and so does the ear via the broca's area. If you push out from the broca's area, you create a connection channel to the star in sky based on hearing/voice. 

This was the original intention by Mother Earth to try to develop an angelic ("birdlike") communication line to us. It ended up becoming more insectile and rarely has pracical value. However, with understanding of Ï€ as star vision, you can understand this star pipe and it's two way flow of communication.
