## Color

Color is frozen gases 

Red is primarily carbon

Blue is primarily oxygen 

Green is primarily nitrogen 

The frozen gases are created by the earth mind, initially based on things grass has “seen”. Grass would grow where there was vision.

The hotter gases of the plant ozone would cool off in the earth mind into color.

This red/blue/green way of seeing could then be reused by flowers, insects, and animals.

The frozen color (each moment) is ice around us, so faster at the quantum level.

It lives first, foreshadowing the reality we then experience with the rest of our eyes & minds

…

During the day our dreams are ice all around us — as color. At night, these colors are more free and spontaneous

Interestingly, it means colors look different to different people - and the reason is the look/feel/stories of your dreams

...

The raw data is the same (the wavelengths). But the "way of seeing" the red/blue/green wavelengths varies by person.
