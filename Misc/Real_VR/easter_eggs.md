## Easter Eggs 

There is a challenge by the sun now to crack out all the remaining “court conflicts” in the deep red center 

This leads to the release of large sun-sized magnetic waves in the mind, which is DMT (eye candy) 

To anyone interested, you can use third-eye meditation to possibly crack out some of these conflicts.

At this point, the sun is ready to convert everything to a red/blue/green shine and deep third-eye meditation is one way to do it.

If a crystal is cracked for the first time, it’s live time for the star 

If it’s done a second time (existing conflict like for example birth DMT) it can be recycled 

If it’s the first time, it’s cool bc you helped in some way to resolve a big conflict of the sun

You’ll then figure out which one, one day

So it can be like Easter eggs, helping the star take super deep breaths, converting gas to “shine” 

...

How do you know it’s “eye candy” DMT 


You know bc the world feels much brighter, due to there being much less criss-crossing of the third eye 

It may even feel like VR 🍭
