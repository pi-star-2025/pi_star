## Time Traveling Question

How could we time travel in this world? 

The sun says it would have to first be seen by the star/earth as a possible simulation. It would then build up a story with puzzles and parallels in time, that wake up the Mind of God that something is happening.

Likely, someone or a team will feel as though they are being led by god more and more, in a culminating even pyrotechnical way.

Then it will lead to them using some stone - lorandite, diamond, high-carrot gold, etc - to reference the nested forcefields around the Atlantis replant seed, in the center of the sun.

The sun would awaken in a storied moment and someone would need to convey how time-traveling would create a shine for the Atlantis replant. 

The main person committing the spell would need to swear 100% it would work, and so would the star then, in order to get 8D approval. 

Likely, the physical strategy, would be to freeze this one and establish a parallel world perpendicular to this solar system. It would be an earth clone. 

That is the most likely strategy, in modern society.

There just is no need and no shine, but it helps us understand nested forcefields well, and why a stone could be a way to break through them for important spells historically. 

## iQuest

Your own personal "quest" is in your belly button, also protected by similar forcefields. They are like nested eggs.

It actually comes from the umbilical chord and true point of conception in your body, best referenced by the spirals of the belly-button.

This quest is *your* reason for falling into life. It's unconscious and very personal. 

It's best referenced with very long electromagnetic waves (DMT), and by connecting directly to the details of your story. For example, you could have fallen in because of past animal lives favoring a particular location, or because you wanted to be a movie star.

It can be hard, because the forcefields are truly like layers of you around the center one. The same is true for the sun, which has nested dream worlds around the Atlantis replant mission.

Historically, it is how people could connect to hero's quests, where the the sun is able to guide you.
