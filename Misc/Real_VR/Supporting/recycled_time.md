## Recycled Time

j = c / 4DR^2

Each eye (star) each tick of time makes a decision to fall *x* distance down π (i.e., 4DR).

If you fall far down π, you are not moving at the speed of c. Then your consciousness speed (j) would be a lot slower, corresponding to 4DR^2.

After time lives at speed j, it starts moving faster and faster until it gets to c. This is the process of becoming working memories, long-term memories, dreams, etc. Once the time moves at c, it becomes the color around you.

For people today, the color is said to be very unconscious. However, if we meditate to be "conscious" as close to the speed of light as possible (with as much blood as possible) each tick of time, then the color around you starts to become as smart the actual person in reality.

The reason is that *every single* tick of time can be reused (recycled), we tend to make time at such a small j value, that much is lost when translating to faster speeds in dreams and as color/environment.
