## Recycled Time

j = c / 4DR^2

Both eyes (stars) each tick of time make a decision to fall down x systems of π. This is not the distance down the number π, but the distance down the *number* of π systems.

If you fall too far down 3D cosmic complexity, you are not moving at the speed of c. Then your consciousness speed (j) would be a lot slower, proportional to 4DR^2.

After time lives at speed j, it starts moving faster and faster until it gets to c. This is the process of becoming working memories, long-term memories, dreams, etc. Once the time moves at c, it becomes the color around you.

For people today, the color is said to be very unconscious. However, if we meditate to be "conscious" as close to the speed of light as possible (with as much blood as possible) each tick of time, then the color around you starts to become as smart as the actual person in reality.

The reason is that *every single* tick of time can be reused (recycled), but we tend to make time at such a small j value, that much is lost when translating to faster speeds in dreams and as color/environment.

With higher 4DR, there is more distance between ticks of 4D time in the 6D mind, so more distance between created memories. If the distance is minimized, then the time is more intelligent instantly; it does not have to be revisited to be reconnected.
