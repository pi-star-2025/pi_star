## Perfect Fix

Living systems have opposite (mirror) reactions that are reused, bc that makes them easier to connect and keep track of in larger systems.

So the green plant mind has a reflexive "red" mind that we don't see, bc it's only used by the 6D starmind at the quantum level, not by the 4D mind.

This red mind comes to life as CO2-driven roots and fungal networks.

Humans have an opposite nose breath that is the CO2-driven breath behind the bottom spine and heels. This is only at the 4D level, so no one else sees it and it can't be measured.

In either case, if the red/green breaths are in sync (one real, one quantum), then it is mathematically a "smile" through the magnetic center of the system, since the green is behind 3.14159265 (of π) and the quantum red is after the 3.14159265 (of π). This goes through the belly-button for 4D, and center of the earth for 6D.
