## Perfect Fix

The top way to reduce 4D π is to make the belly-button smaller.

A top way to make the belly-button smaller is to reduce the amount of air in the deep-belly, which is also the long-term amount of average lung air in your body.

...

A secret is that lung air can only stick around and have a big impact if it is "cool" enough. Once it heats up, then it integrates with the rest of the 4D body and decreases the pressure of the whole system.

So with age and use of the body, everyone begins to decrease their 4D axis (π) by ~40.

...

In addition, everyone has different amounts of cool air in the eyes. If you have more cool air, which has never entered the body and become hot, you then have a higher 4D axis (higher π). If you have less overall air in the eyes, the length of π is shorter, which makes all colors stronger.

The reason we don't reference this cool air that often is because it is very "slippery". We *see* things in very strong ways without realizing it.
