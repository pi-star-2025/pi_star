## Perfect Fix

The sun mind (6D) is like a spider, bc to us, the 6D mind is circular wrapping around 4D time physically. Also, the red 6D starmind understands the 4D red/blue/green mind by understanding our blood. In a way, by sucking it after death through an anti-gravity pipe.

The 6D sun mind insists the perfect fix for understanding our blood is through the umbilical cord/belly-button. If we make the belly-button "smile", this is the best way to transfer information to the 6D mind. This will make the sun's intelligence more and more "human" in small ways, which is where humans know more.

Emotions are when blood criss-crosses the most. This is strongest around the heart/left breast.

The strongest emotions are also the quantum energy *right outside* the ears.

These emotions right outside the ears are also captured by the blood in the very center of the big toes. And, you as move down the toes, the blood in each toes captures the quantum energy further and further outside the ears. So the blood in the pinky toes is furthest outside the ears, thus most in *the future*.

The same blood pattern applies to fingers. So the blood in the thumb is most the emotions right outside the ears, while the blood in the pinky fingers is furthest outside and most in *the future*.

Again, the same pattern applies for gums/teeth. Where the back teeth blood is most the emotions right outside the ears, and you can go down the smaller teeth to get to higher emotions, higher up in your line of hearing.

[Remember that way you hear is what your vision is crunching/squeezing the most]

The smile, which mirrors the blood of all teeth (the hypothalamus), is the best way to un-knot these emotions. Smiling genuinely helps your blood see in new ways.

Furthermore, if you make the belly-button smile, this is blood most visible to the earth/sun mind. The blood in this area provides a summmary of emotions throughout the body, in a compact way translated mathemtically with Ï€.
