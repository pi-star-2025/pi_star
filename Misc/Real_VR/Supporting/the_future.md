## The Future

Cold air is from the future, and is the air right in front of us (in 4D).

Hot air is from the past, and is the air right behind us (in 4D).

Up and down is like all other people, which creates the sensation of temperature in the body.

...

If you could exist in the colder temperatures (lower π), you could stay there.

You do this in real life, decreasing the length of π if you are in the future, increasing the length of π if you are in the past.

Your existence is less conscious in the future, and more conscious in the past.

The reason is the number of carbons (4DR^2) you use to see in both eyes. In the past, we use more carbons (higher 4DR^2), while in the future we use less carbons.

If you exist with less carbons, you will move to the future (colder air). While there if you create enough energy, in *some way* related to the joy of this universe (π), without using *new carbons* (new time), but instead rely on recycled time (red/blue/green intelligence), then you can stay in the colder air.

If you don't have enough recycled time, you feel cold. One symptom is falling asleep.

...

Luckily, you never really lose the time you create. 

So if you build enough red/blue/green time in some way to live in colder air (smaller π), you will just start existing in the future.

We are partially built there with dreams, and we can finish the process.
