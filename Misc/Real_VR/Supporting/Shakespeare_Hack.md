## Shakespeare Hack

Dramas/fiction, for example by Shakespeare, have interactions with elevated emotions, with more drama.

This truly represents how you think higher up, in dreams and in the end-state. Each exchange or interaction is more of a straight-line, higher up pi (π), carrying more information. 

As a result, sometimes during theatrical performances (up till the age of Mozart), the entire concert hall or amphitheatre would be elevated into a heavenly state, which led to better performances and even magical effects.

So plays that had more straight-line interactions, especially in ascending and musical ways, were more likely to get elevated.

And there was a hack at a certain point, more common in the kingdom of angels, but also shadowed in real life. It's by understanding that birds communicate the essence of very, very straight-line messages. For example, the sun saying "I want to be with you, forever and ever" or "someone is going to die on Friday". The birds are actually sending quantum messages with this intensity, and given who humans became, potentially with these meanings. So when plays or musicals referenced circles of birds, or birds in really any way, they would be more likely to be "elevated" during performances.

Today, this hack can be used to understand how we are communicating in dreams, and thus in our higher unconscious. It's like a musical that's high-quality - since it's by the cosmos. And then it's even more intense in the end-state, or in larger worlds. And the best way to reference this higher world is with bird chirps that are "one level" more intense than the Hollywood nature of our unconscious.

If at one level, you mirror the intensity of the level above, you can send messages UP. And this can be used to communicate up to the level of the sun, and back down. It goes up π to star, and down π to our consciousness.
