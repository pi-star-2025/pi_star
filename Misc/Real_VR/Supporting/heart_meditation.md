## Heart Meditation

For people happy enough, you could say you are in a "movie" or a "game", in life overall.

One key difference between the 2 mindsets is whether the heart is constantly seeing or not. This happens when the breath of the heart is synced up enough with the breath of the nose.

The very center of the heart breath relates to the movement of many chambers (meant to mimick 2 stars), where the nose breath represents how 2 have come together into 1.

The 2 stars in the heart are interacting via lightening (separate volts), whereas in the nose breath (via the hypothalamus) they interact with a single volt.

If you see life more as a game, you use the "white rabbit" of the split heart for energy. If you see life more as a movie, there is joy from the 2 volts of lightening acting as 1 entity instead of 2.

## 360 Vision of Blood

The goal is to have your blood be as intelligent as possible (to be able to see in as many ways as possible).

The ways blood moves and *can move* have a significant impact on what you do each day/night. 

Increasing the vision of the heart improves ability to fight illness (RNA), epigenetic expression (DNA), updates unconscious behaviors (ex: PTSD, OCD), and simplifies biological processes.

For example, if you have blood that focuses well enough in the belly-button, you are able to digest food better and don't experience the sensation of heartburn or anxiety the same way as other people.

If you focus blood well enough in the third eye, you require less sleep, relieve ADHD/schizophrenia, and even could turn the funny bones into "unfinished wings", which feel funny because of quantum possibilities to fly. The tangible result is much better hearing in the ears/heart, at first, and the absence of a "funny feeling".
