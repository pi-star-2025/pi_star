## TV Show Trick

Since a TV is *so close* to true color, sometimes it can act as an intermediary between color and your mind, using the characters/plot in the show.

In our universe, this only works if you are like in "hollywood" or "anti-hollywood" moments in your life (in cosmic ways), when watching the TV show or movie or video game.

However, with realistic 3D/4D VR this could be improved, so that you could always feel like you are in a hollywood or anti-hollywood moment. The better the VR box, the more consistent the effects. In other words, the cosmic realm and the TV realm start to get intertwined.

You can teach your mind to get more intertwined with the "TV world" or "VR world" by simply understanding you should use parallels to plots/characters/colors to send messages into your eyes.

The pixel patterns in the TV can be closely replicated in the eyes, which is a consistent "language" with the cosmic/angel level.
