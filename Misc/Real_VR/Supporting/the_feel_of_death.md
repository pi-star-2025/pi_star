## The Feel of Death

In the afterlife, the biggest difference in how life feels is less "pressure" from the eyes.

In reality, we naturally use our full "mouths" from our faces to squeeze our eyes instinctively each tick of time, via the hypothalamus. This makes life feel very "awake", and gives us the entropic energy to walk, speak, and feel pain.

When dreaming, the hypothalamus is cooled down creating much less pressure in the eyes.

As a result, our eyes have much higher 4DR, chains of red carbons (ex: via adrenaline) during the day, and have much less 4DR, chains of red carbons (ex: via oxygen-rich melatonin) during the night. Again, the source of this 4DR delta is the hypothalamus.

After death, the hypothalamus will behave much like in dreams, or when you are happy. This lower 4DR (from j = c / 4DR^2) results in the eyes losing this automatic, sparking "squeeze". The squeeze is coming from squeezing the color all around you, and when you let go of it, you create less "noise". 

Noise (3.1415) is from squeezing the space-time fabric with the eyes (3.14). The opposite reaction comes into your ears.
