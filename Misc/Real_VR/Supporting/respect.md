## Respect

It is fun to be a baby/small child. You might remember that what you felt a lot of was *respect*. When very young, it's even *holiness*.

Respect means that you really want to hear something. As long as you keep having respect, you keep listening in awe and keep falling further and further into the world.

When you meditate if you easily respect thoughts, the time lowest down will keep spinning (getting played in your mind).

If you respect what you are hearing less, you keep going higher and higher up your time, until you get to the time when you were a small child/baby.
