You fall asleep 

Both you and the sun 

When you have one single thought that goes up straight enough (like the 1 in π)

Usually this only happens "in the dark"

Or with melatonin, which significantly reduces “seeing” decisions

...

In the after life, both people and seers have only a single thought, including the final triangle. Each individual "circle" has only 1 thought at the end. 

Sleep is a way to practice. The ways you fall asleep are like "wishes".

...

If you can do it during the day, you can "cheat death".

But then you are still alive above. So you might become a "cartoon", but you could still die as a cartoon.
