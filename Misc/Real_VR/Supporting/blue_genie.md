You can live as certain air outside the body, especially when sleeping. 

The most intelligent air is perhaps in the belly button, or right outside of it. 

It can simualate the air of any living spirit, including Mother Earth.

At this point, mechanically you could ask Mother Earth to help you get to Real_VR, or dreaming awake.

At night, the air in the eyes actually can get many feet, even miles, outside the body. The eyes have a lot of power, especially if you focus both together. But if you are down to earth/in reality, the belly button is easier to focus.
