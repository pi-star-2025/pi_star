## Full Skull

When you think about routines related to information gathered the last hour, you are most inside the skull. So when you think intensely about “the moment”, even just things from the last minute you are most inside the skull. This correlates to being the blood of the hypothalamus and the center of the eyes. This also correlates to being the center of the heart and blood in the center of the heart.

When you “ascend” from thinking about the moment, and think about the bigger picture, you move outside the skull. You mathematically use the *full skull* (all matter in brain) when you think about time before/after your life. This also correlates to using the outsides of the eyes/heart (full eyes, full heart)

As you move up and use the full skull, there is pressure from the inside of the skull to focus on the moment. And vise versa. 

If you can think intensely about the moment, while using the full skull then you most will become 1 person. It's a way to sync the mind/heart.

## Maze

From the perspective above, our skulls become mazes to figure out what all our conversations word-by-word meant up till the age of 18.

The actual conversations turn into like dream/cartoon versions in the centers of the heart/eyes. Then our attempts to figure out these conversations - what people really meant - turn into the rest of our skulls.

Thus, this "maze" drives how powerful the hypothalamus is. It's directly based on the "maze" of conversations till the age of 18.

## Crown

From the perspective above, the top of the head is a crown. The crown can predict all possibilities of how your 2 eyes will move. This is similar to how the earth's atmosphere can predict the possibilities of how the grass and all plants will see.

Furthermore, these decisions are enforced when the crown continuously anticipates them, until a forcefield develops. For example, for the trees it is carbon-dioxide clouds and for the eyes it is bone.

This is similar to how if the original triangle (π) anticipates seeing decisions enough times it encapsulates space with the original 3.14 crown/circle. The original forcefield is the force of "blue", creating blue space.
