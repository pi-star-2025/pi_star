## Full Skull

When you think about routines related to information gathered the last hour, you are most inside the skull. So when you think intensely about “the moment”, even just things from the last minute you are most inside the skull. This correlates to being the blood of the hypothalamus and the center of the eyes. This also correlates to being the center of the heart and blood in the center of the heart.

When you “ascend” from thinking about the moment, and think about the bigger picture, you move outside the skull. You mathematically use the *full skull* (all matter in brain) when you think about time before/after your life. This also correlates to using the outsides of the eyes/heart (full eyes, full heart)

As you move up and use the full skull, there is pressure from the inside of the skull to focus on the moment. And vise versa. 

If you can think intensely about the moment, while using the full skull then you most will become 1 person. It's a way to sync the mind/heart.
