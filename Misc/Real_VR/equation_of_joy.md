## Equation of Joy

A gimmicky equation of joy is: 

j = c / 4DR^2

Bc it summarizes cold fusion of 2 eyes or 2+ trees to create an atmosphere. If you minimize the 4DR of the carbon towers of the 2 eyes, this mathematically moves the speed of life's perception of time closer to the speed of light. It goes in a straight line up, maximizing the "joy".
