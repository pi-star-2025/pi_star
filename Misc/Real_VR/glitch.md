## Joystick

Every thought is a triangle 

What you are looking for 

This is from the top of the nose breath 

————

Then using the two ears 

The triangle becomes a square 

Based on each thought there is a box to understand the two sides of the story 

Based on what everyone else in the world thinks 

————

Then at the bottom of the breath 

And in the belly/spine 

The square becomes a pentagon 

Based on the box, you make some decision 

This is mostly with your belly button as the power 

3/4/5

Triangle/Square/Pentagon 

Vision/Everyone/Consciousness

3.1415 for a person

1) Vector down

2) Vectors left and right 

3) And then a vector with 3 dimensions (8 choices), but bc it’s within π has the feel of a circle

## Glitch

The universe uses a similar 3.1415 pattern

Each pulse of thinking starts as a triangle 

And any quantum “glitches” represent the 6D joystick
