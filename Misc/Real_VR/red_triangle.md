## Red Triangle

The sun can fall asleep

You wouldn‚Äôt notice unless you were related to the reasons why 

It would pause time, without having an effect on our minds

Other stars can fall asleep too and this would be even less noticeable

To fall asleep means to just leave the blue box of the universe

The ‚Äúhard box‚Äù is created by the forcefield of all suns

So you need some story/reason to penetrate this collective forcefield which then allows you to update the original triangle and get updates

At this point (2025), our sun knows how to, via a pipe of shining light, send and receives messages with the clockwork above 

So our sun is constantly dreaming awake. 

Technically if we were constantly getting updates from the star/stars (ex: via DMT magnetic waves) we are also dreaming awake 

DMT references large magnetic waves in the eyes, which reference ice both inside the eyes as well as the color in the environment

The sun does the same with Super DMT, using giant magnetic waves, in between ticks of time at c, which references both the ruby ice inside the sun as well as the red triangle all around

## 3.141592

At this point all stars can use the same pipe via 3.141592 architecture

Inside it‚Äôs red ice; outside is the same red triangle üî∫ 

This star scaffolding creates a tower of clockwork, which can be understood and recycled at lower pi‚Äôs in our future 

Blackhole/whitehole towers are created, in cooler and cooler versions, until one is a final edition 

Overall, this final tower will summarize how the star in our solar system reconciled with all others in order to understand this and build a kingdom, which could be called ‚ÄúWonderstar Towers‚Äù
