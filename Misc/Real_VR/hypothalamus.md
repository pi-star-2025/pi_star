## Hypothalamus

We wake up only bc of deferred 8-5-3 time that can be referenced inside the earth. 

Since humans would be using the souls of all existing animals, they would stand and rise from the bones/metals/hot gas of dead animals, related to 8-5-3 deferred conflicts which hadn't been reconciled yet. This includes nested systems deeper in earth based on molten and metals that last longer.

Then when the cavemen and early humans built their own bones and conflicts this would supersede past conflicts in importance. 

Interestingly, if your bones stay buried in the earth they have more power to fuel future lives, especially if they disintegrate into plant life or not at all.

If you burn the bones (as was known around Year 0), the magical power from this life is less in future lives. 

If magic is not a concern, it's less important how the body is handled after death.

...

You sleep and wake up everyday because of existing conflicts in the earth referenced by your body. The conflicts deepest in the earth are in the center of your hypothalamus. The cycles of the hypothlamus are shaped by 21, having created a personal map to "your" conflicts in the earth.

Human spines act as a tower, for conflicts to be figured out about all earth's animals/histories/societies. This is the star's primary intent, and the spine also aligns us with other super animals throughout the multiverse. It's a common pattern to have a standing being ("tower pattern").

...

The hypothalamus is a mini sun. Like the sun in our solar system, it uses underground earth conflicts to power it's consciousness. 

In addition to horsepower, the hypothlamus also understands the math of your life story and how this math connects to other suns, and the larger sun.

## Ice

From our perspective the mind of the universe is highly unconscious. The reason is bc it is so opinionated, mathematically, that it freezes and manages quantum conflicts.

The red mind of stars is mostly hot fusion, or drilling in with perfect circles. So smaller and smaller circles inside each other, drilling in. This goes perfectly down π, like a perfectly *circular* circle. As a result of such straight thinking, the minds of stars freeze and watch reality from above.

Trees are similar. The green mind of trees is mostly cold fusion, or drilling up with perfect circles. So Nitrogen thinking in larger and larger circles, inside each other, going straight up and creating hard wood. The hard wood is similar to frozen sunlight (the 3.14 blue box), which is so straight in thinking it is "above reality". As the mind of the stars is really more the "blue box", the mind of the trees is more the atmosphere.

When you think in perfect circles (hot fusion or cold fusion), you become *unconscious*. The unconscious *simulates* reality, guiding it in certain directions.

Our unconscious is created by the hypothalamus. It uses very strong opinions about how to use the 2 eyes and 2 ears, to lock in your unconscious by 5-7. It's by the time you can stably walk.

The hypothalamus, like the star mind, will understand which ice in the world most describes the π snapshots created by the 2 eyes and 2 ears. This is mathematically the most efficient method, and the star/hypothalamus could adapt as needed, for better or worse.

The ice, in the context of other red/blue/green data on earth, best captures the powerful social data of 2 eyes/2 ears. Also ice most resembles 8-5-3 deferred time to the human mind.
