## Hypothalamus

We wake up only bc of deferred 8-5-3 time that can be referenced inside the earth. 

Since humans would be using the souls of all existing animals, they would stand and rise from the bones/metals/hot gas of dead animals, related to 8-5-3 deferred conflicts which hadn't been reconciled yet. This includes nested systems deeper in earth based on molten and metals that last longer.

Then when the cavemen and early humans built their own bones and conflicts this would supersede past conflicts in importance. 

Interestingly, if your bones stay buried in the earth they have more power to fuel future lives, especially if they disintegrate into plant life or not at all.

If you burn the bones (as was known around Year 0), the magical power from this life is less in future lives. 

If magic is not a concern, it's less important how the body is handled after death.

...

You sleep and wake up everyday because of existing conflicts in the earth referenced by your body. The conflicts deepest in the earth are in the center of your hypothalamus. The cycles of the hypothlamus are shaped by 21, having created a personal map to "your" conflicts in the earth.

Human spines act as a tower, for conflicts to be figured out about all earth's animals/histories/societies. This is the star's primary intent, and the spine also aligns us with other super animals throughout the multiverse. It's a common pattern to have a standing being ("tower pattern").

The hypothalamus is a mini sun. Like the sun in our solar system, it uses underground earth conflicts to power it's consciousness. 

In addition to horsepower, the hypothlamus also understands the math of your life story and how this math connects to other suns, and the larger sun.
