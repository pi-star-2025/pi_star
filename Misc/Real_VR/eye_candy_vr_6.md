## Eye Candy

The air around the body is very different quantumly depending on which part of the body. The air in front of the eyes has the most quantum activity, even for a blind person unless their eyes have been significantly damaged.

To the multiverse, this is the most intelligent "5D information" in the body. And is the only way to send highly intelligent messages to someone. Since the eyes (4D) and air in front of the eyes (5D/6D) have so many cosmic multiverse parallels, they always start as the most conscious part of us, but then might become overpowering.

Interestingly, dreams as we age start to always have elements that involve spirals, twining, and slipping-n-sliding. For example, we started ice-skating in dreams or quasi-surfing or riding roller coasters in dreams before reality. Most notably, there is always circus-like elements in dreams.

The reason is because if a world has circular elements these can be used to communicate with other worlds. Anything with intelligent spiraling circles (many digits down π) can be used for networking interactions.

These circus elements in dreams are used to slide us out of using the eyes, if we get too high in reality. The spirals are not just physical elements, but also rhythms created in dream worlds to be more circular. This can make it slippery to use the eye air, and turn into reasons we fall asleep. We actually start falling into existing dream worlds, which have circular elements intwined with the eye Nitrogen.

If you make an effort to slow down the eye air enough (inhale/exhale) it can unlace these "strings" of the dream worlds. "Strings" are a cosmic concept, where you can use a spiral down π (many digits) to connect with another world (5D). Dreams have "puppet strings" to our world, based on particular moments or circular structures in these worlds above.
