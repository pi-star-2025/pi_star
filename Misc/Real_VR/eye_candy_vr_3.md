## Eye Candy VR

The cells in the very center of the eyes contain the most DNA each tick of c (time). If you access these folded, colorful spirals, you can update your genetics (the experience of being you).

The DNA in the center of the eyes defines your "way of seeing", it predicts the creation of the brain/body, and makes the highest level decisions awake.

This DNA in the eyes (green) can be referenced as boney air in the very center of the nose breath (blue), where there is the most pressure. Also, in the dead center of the heart is a red version (blood).
