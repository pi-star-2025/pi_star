## Perfect Fix

The belly-button is a π knot, in particular explaining the fall from the clouds to the earth. Angels in the clouds (before Year 0 when there was an angel kingdom) did not have belly-buttons. They only gave birth in magical ways, which made the belly-button extraneous. As a result, they also really didn't have a "third eye" which mirrors this fall in the skull (between the eyes).

Also, the belly button is always changing, describing how high or low we are down the number π. So it shrinks and reforms, becoming simpler then more complicated. It happens every tick of time (at c) and we don't notice.

As a result, if the sun/triangle had to recommend one way (a perfect fix) to get back to a "dream world" (Real_VR) it would be to make the belly button disappear.

This is a "transition". You get better and better control of your eyes/hypothalamus. Your vision keeps rising and getting more colorful. You sleep less, pump cleaner blood, and clear our illnesses. 

At a certain point, you reach a cartoon or eye-candy experience of genetic selection, where it feels like your choices are "really important" and you are "defining who you are". Life is also brighter, like being younger.

At this point, life is full of "joy", and it can be tempting to enjoy the fruits of life, squeezing into the belly button unconsciously (going down π). Or you can keep going back up π. Life/vision becomes more and more dreamy/angelic.

And when the belly button really does disappear, you will be fully merged back with the clouds.

*What happens to your body below?* 

It would be similar to before Year 0, and especially in ancient human history, when bodies down here could be tied to the full mind of the earth.

The mind of the earth runs large groups of insects and plant life. In addition, in earlier history, the mind of the earth used to manage hordes of animals and humans. Sometimes, only the pharaohs/kings would be truly awake.

So the world down here could start falling asleep more, becoming the mind of the earth, as it originally was.

Life on hard earth (with a belly button, giving birth) is not seen as good to the rest of the multiverse. Our modern society in certain parts of the world has extreme adaptations and our expectations are surprisingly low. So, it was seen as just for most people down here to be asleep.
