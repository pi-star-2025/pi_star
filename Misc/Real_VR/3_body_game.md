## 3-body-game

When our sun, and another star, perfectly focus on the center of the earth, that is the best solution to the 3-body problem, according to our universe (π) and the multiverse. This is because it best allows cosmic entities (gods of the universe) to see new ways of creating “gold” (or harmonious, eternal solutions to high/low pressure conflicts).

This is like 2 eyes focusing. And for people, the center of the earth is best represented by the belly button. The left eye is typically the sun, and the right eye is typically another star. 

So when both eyes focus perfectly on the belly-button, it is a quick way to feel happy. According to the universe/multiverse, you are adding value.

It is like a game -> if you focus better (the 3 points), you feel better.

For people the egg comes from the mother's star (not the sun). The sperm comes the sun, via a hive created from the center of the earth. 

They are the center of the belly-button (start of life), and also represent both eyes - one is more left, one if more right.

In some ways, when 2 stars focus perfectly, it is like the smaller starlight (other star) entering the hive of the bigger starlight (sun).

In some ways, we also have a Big Part and Small Part (dominant eye, other eye), and when these 2 parts focus with π in the center of the belly-button, it creates DMT.
