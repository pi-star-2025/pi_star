## Third Eye

In the third eye is the best way to reference the pressure of all star spikes, from not just the star in the sky, but all stars in the universe. 

It is like wheel spokes, spiraled inside to just a small space.

To turn the “hard box” into a “VR box”, you need to convert the red sun spikes first to blue/green gas, and then to a cool red/blue/green magnetic shine.

This is the same challenge for the sun. The third eye is like the earth, with all life (including plants/trees) creating spokes of light back to the sun. 

The 8-5-3 quantum light needs to turn into blue/green gas, and then into a red/blue/green magnetic shine. Whatever has already turned into a red/blue/green shine can be used for dreams and heaven, which influence reality.

The best technique is breath. 

Deep deep breaths actually align with the rhythms of oceans. 

So for the earth mind, the best way to convert larger 8-5-3 banks into shine is with deep breaths paralleling the oceans.

Technically, if the hot metals in the center listen it has maximum effect. 

This is like our heart listening to our third eye
