## White Rabbit

6D air all around us can be part of our 4D experience. 

It tends to move in a perfect straight line up, and just feels like the boundary of life. What stops you from being the color around you. 

You can feel this straight line up most in the eyes, the air in the eyes, which also moves in a perfect straight line up/down usually. It’s said sodium levels in the eyes can enhance this.

However, when you move it around more in all directions (8 directions) you can blend in more with the 6D. 

The air around you is most time (the “white rabbit”), and if you wake it up as straight lines up/down, it then becomes more than just a boundary, and you can have more control of what your experience of life feels like. 

So the less you feel the pressure of “time”, the more you can control the large electromagnetic 6D waves and if they become wiggly enough, you can start to move objects and even focus enough to use your environment as a simulation booth. For example, it would be common to look into the waves of a lake or ocean, and speak to a ghost with enough focus, or even start to play out where horses would move in battle.

The reason this is possible is because the air around you is moving in many directions, not straight lines. Also instead of hearing the environment as a “ring”, it becomes more a “hum”
