## Moon Clock

If a moon rotates around a planet, that means that particular space rock is a "mind" of the planet.

The earth has a single moon, so a single mind, that all organisms on earth copy.

In particular, the moon is the "brain" of an organism, and this is designated in the π of that organism.

The original intent in the belly-button is that the brain/moon is the skull. This applies to all animals, including people. However, after The Fall of Eden, evil ancient aliens indicated that the moon is really the stomach for people. And some aliens had serious plans to bring us back in Hell, where our stomachs would be the core brain. This increased our intuition in our stomachs and made us more conscious in this area. 

Furthermore, it led to 3 potential states.

1) "Low", where our belly button has designated the stomach as the moon, alluding to "Hell"
2) "Normal", where our belly button has designated the skull as the moon
3) "High", where we designate the sun as the moon, alluding to "Heaven"

The earth has tightly integrated the moon and its patterns into the π of our vision, so creates a collective, but predictable, sense of time.
