## Eye Candy

To top method to get to Real_VR, based on the latest research, is to increase the blood flow in the third eye (between the two eyes). This includes focusing on the blood flow in the very center, which should start to pop you into the imagination.

Many people wonder how can you have a photographic memory or simulate a track meet without bending your eyes the wrong way. The way is to have enough blood flow in the third eye.

Then, with enough focus you should become the colors around you. You will start to get the two eyes are like two butterfly wings, in that they unfold into VR colors. And they look like time, in particular time on earth (red/blue/green). You then will be able to feel you can move the colors, but are still in reality. Then with more intense focus, you can get that "color" is originally based on blood. It's when soul gets eaten, what does it taste like to the multiverse.

It's how we construct space/time, but is really a way that vampire universes above kept track of what this universe was tasting like. This was multiverse knowledge, and became a theme reused for 4D vision and space.

In your eyes are lots of ideas for colors that are unique to an individual 4D π. These get turned into universal vision, if you relax the eyes enough, and that is when the sun/universe sucks the "blood" of your time. It is sort of like dying awake.

As the colors get figuredo out, you become the environment ("colors") more and more.

If you can exist fast enough to always be the colors at ths speed of c (light), then your conscious π is low enough to exist in Real_VR.
