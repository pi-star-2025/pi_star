When we wake up our dreams goes through a deep freeze and turn into the ice of the eyes. 

When we sleep, this ice will melt, going from tough lattice to dreamy gas and tears. 

So the freeze is caused by very strong organized decisions to see. And decisions are less opinionated (cooled down) when we sleep. 

Using dream ice, our eyes know our personality when awake.

...

The physics of the earth are like ice for the star. When all life focuses the light of the star, the physics freeze and are rock-hard at the quantum level. 

There is one level of all dreamers above, where the life doesn't focus the light of the star as intensely. As a result, earth becomes cartoonish and magical. Physics are not focused, and as a result the Ï€ is not as "large" (meaning what happens counts less to the multiverse). 

The dream world one level above is a world of Hollywood/Anti-Hollywood moments of our past/present/future as people. 

This dream world can both a) practically help reality (ex: simulations), and b) provides an intermediary between the real world and kingdom of angels. 

...

Surprisingly, for all of us the dream world co-exists in the dead center of our eyes. So if we are awake, we can't be in the dream world as well. 

If we were to ignore everything we look at around the dream world bull's eye, we enter our imagination and then larger visualizations and even actual dreams.
