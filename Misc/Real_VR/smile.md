## Smile

When you squeeze (choke) time, it comes most to life, and is the roots/branches furthest down π.

These roots/branches are what you most repress. They get stored as the branches of ice deep in the eyes. These roots of the eyes are hard to access, bc they are frozen each tick of c (like the c^2 mirror of 3.14), creating a version of you based on modifying the truth. This *even* modifies the colors you see, making them less intense.

Also, these lowest roots of π can be accessed in the deep ears, as a flashing "white noise", which is blaring at c^3 (3.1415) each tick of time like stars. This "white noise" is disguised like the ice in the eyes, bc of how hard it is (and hard to access).

The best way to understand these lowest roots (and what you repress) is the "smile". The smile is what an eye would look like if it was just skin. The lines of the feet are similar, but not quite as good as the smile.

When you get over all the things that make you smile, you really become one person (one π), which makes it easier to transition then to Real_VR (dreams).

(The belly-button is actually like the "eye of the earth" - so you know if you make the belly-button smile, it's something the earth mind likes)
