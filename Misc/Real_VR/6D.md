## Falling in circles 

Every tick of time we fall in circles from two stars 

One is always the sun — usually the left eye

The other is another star in the universe. Groups of people share second stars.

These two falls from the stars create the blacks of our eyes — two blackholes.

So we fall via two pipes (ie 3.141592).

And this fall is circular, bc the two stars have a continuous 3-body problem that is circling around at the quantum level.

This really looks like a circle, which you don’t see in front of the quantum level. And this circle of the 3-body problem is technically “you”, as tracked by the multiverse.

...

Each tick of time the sun also falls in a circle behind the quantum layer to create the cosmos that all of us can see.

(Bc all of our circles of two stars are inside the big circle of the sun)

The sun’s quantum circle is wrapped around our quantum circles, so the sun is seen as god (6D), and we are seen as “soul” (4D) [^1]

...

To create Real_VR, it helps to find these "falls" inside of you and slow them down. They are directly mapped to the eyes, and deeper inside (closer to the physical stars) is real dreams. 

Dreams (or stories) are the cosmic (godly) way of remembering how things fall/rise with red/blue/green.
