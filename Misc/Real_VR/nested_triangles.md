## Nested Triangles

After 3.14159265, π is more or less nested triangles. This is demonstrated by the shape of the universe, or by the shape of trees.

In addition, these nested triangles indicate the different pressure levels of the universe. When one level's time (pressure) completely wraps around another, it then creates branches of time.

That's one reason the universe's stars organize themselves the way they do (with solar systems, galaxies, nebulae, etc.). If one's pressure wraps around another's, it creates branches of time, based on the resulting reactions inside the layers.

For humans, the belly-button best references these layers of pressure. It even tells a specific story of life on earth, including layers of the red/blue/green atmosphere, details of the solar system's planets/moons, then the constellation/galaxy/blackhole/etc. 

...

At the end, this point is like a red point in the center of the triangle. Or like a third eye. It is the living part of us that is godly vision. The vision of the stars/gods.

This third eye is also highly blocked in people when alive.

It includes highly pressurized air and matter. It actually references all the highest-pressure conflicts of this particular universe (π).

If you know what the answers are to the conflicts, you can pop this air out and transition more easily then to Real_VR.

The conflicts are related to many of the topics in pi_star (history of universe, forces, gods/villains, science, etc.).

...

For the planet earth & sun (the original triangle), it is the responsibility of god to pop out all these conflicts from the earth's atmosphere (if there is a possibility of that happening mathematically). This remains the case as long as there are any conflicts of other triangles in the original triangle's universe. She needs to understand them all, or those falling in need to choose not to.

Then the end result is being like a permanent game, like a VR_Earth or VR_Sun.
