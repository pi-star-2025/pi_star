## The Joker

To die awake 

You need to automate yourself below (in real life) 

It’s possible 

But it may seem impossible 

The way is to figure out all reasons you laugh and understand them, so it’s an all an act 

It’s said if you really do, then you will succeed in dying awake 

...

You would go to the dream world which is now unified, serving as a transition to the kingdom of angels (heaven), while also influencing the simulations/memories of real life awake

...

The strongest humor is the feeling of "dark magic". It's what confuses god the most, and thus can be used for power, whether spiritual/temporal/physical. 

Hence, the alias of the most evil ancient alien was The Joker bc he just wanted as much chaos (ie confusion) as possible.

It's said like Shakespeare plays, some of us create characters of ourselves, why our more conscious selves die awake. There is a rumor that Mozart is one of the last to do so. He didn't die "consciuosly".
