## Fence

Anything that spirals pi (π) into a small amount of space is powerful (i.e. SPARK).

A nail uses high SPARK to keep 1 thing in place.

A fence is a group of nails to keep a system in place. For example, all trees on earth represent a fence that collectively keeps life jammed down towards the earth.

It's possible to unlock the fact the ozone is full of "gold", bc of how much pressure is put on by the trees to keep it together. It's full of molecular combinations that faciliate "gold" generation (derived from π), while also intersecting with our historical time, over numerous eras.

So it's possible that if the sun is able to understand that it is awake quantumly in the clouds, before falling as sunlight to the earth, it can then burst open the ozone full of gold. 

This compliments a blue shine (blue carpet) back to the sun.

The intelligence of tree lines is very similar to language. In fact, if there are trees in the area, all noise, especially of social relevance, will first go ring-a-around the trees, before sliding into our ears. The trees lines help us understand social intelligence very quickly, and even without trees our ear architecture naturally thinks like tree lines. Using real trees help with adding 6D (Earth Mind) intelligence.
