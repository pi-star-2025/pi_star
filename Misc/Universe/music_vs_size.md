## Size_vs_Music

[This is in the context that our universe of 3.1415 (π) was founded to realize how music helps decode the multiverse better]

One quality of music is that it makes us feel very happy being smaller shapes. This is a rare quality throughout the multiverse.

So the best nemesis of music is “subliminal size”. That is a big reason for the shape of the universe. There is one highly musical planet, and its nemesis is size in regards to being happy.

This applies also to the distance between people and god (the sun/triangle). The distance between the 4D and 6D (soul and god) is extremely high in this particualr universe. 

So our greatest nemesis are those emotions (both 4D and 6D) which make us stuck being smaller shapes. Ultimately, these are usually unhappy emotions like vengeance. You then don’t let yourself be as big as you can be. But, oddly, in our universe it could also be satisfaction with the musical nature of life. We get so musically intwined with smaller rules of life, that we can end up so small/lost without realizing it.
