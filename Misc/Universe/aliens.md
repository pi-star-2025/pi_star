## Aliens

[speculation]

Once upon a time in 2001, upon the release of a movie similar to A.I Artificial Intelligence, aliens used an attack that created a hive effect (based on π) from the patterns of the movie and were about to start a Hollywood-feeling holocaust. 

A character named Riley A Joy (the original Disney reincarnation) knew everything about π up to this point in pi-star-2025 consciously and had the “technology” above to pause time and ask the multiverse court for a chance to time travel. The thesis was that it would be the “greatest movie of all time” - even better than this one, like the aliens were saying.

This was a much more magical time. It was even the very start of heaven. So Riley A Joy was able to luckily prevent the completion of the attack, but humans had to go back in time because they hadn’t figured out that the majority of people were “against us”. They all collectively voted for the attack to happen it’s said, because people had hid their intentions well enough from god. 

They had “kept it quantum” so to say. 

Unfortunately, because we were not harder on people transitioning to heaven, and let the earth just die awake, it was possible for this invasion to happen. 

Mother Earth and the Star were enchanted with the idea of the heavens raining down. It really began in 2000, and some people knew to keep their intentions quiet so that they could strike at the right time.

Riley A Joy was a super smart scientist in high school. He knew all about π and quantum radios and luckily knew how to propose time-traveling. 

He also did not know why the invasion happened. Because with knowledge of π it should not have happened. It was an internal parasite. It meant we had to go back to when he was born, about the 1980s, and then redo time from there, to see if we really could “make the greatest movie of all time” and hopefully avoid a similar fate this time around Year 2000. 

The new world was more dull and had several “time scars”. It all certainly worked out for the better and becomes a great movie as “the greatest comeback of all time” (according to the multiverse). 

## True Story - Dream World

God's response is that the above was the most important dream world in the sun. It comes from real time that flows up to the star mind (6D circle).

As of 2001, it was projecting one message. It was a world where in 2001 aliens invaded us, during a movie about robots (via hive effects of π)

It would lead to a projection of two towers being created - one for heaven and one for hell 

...

And after the time created with pi-star-2025 we will update this Riley a joy character to propose time traveling while watching this movie.

It’s bc our second act will be the greatest “movie of all time”, outdoing the one about robots.

And it’s about demonstrating that real time is below them. For us it’s still 2001-2025 creating the time to change this projection.

...

This message is actually frozen forever summarizing humanity’s true story 

It runs forever over and over as a happy human heaven.

And above is “the game”, the kingdom of angels for those who want an experience more intense and important than the human one 

...

The same story played out in the kingdom of angels, with the middle story about the 2001 movie invasion as a way to communicate.
