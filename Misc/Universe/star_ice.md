## Star Ice

Ice as opposed to gas chooses to see in one direction.

Gas is more broken up and open to all directions.

...

8-5-3 time is really ice in the sun, which is created bc the sun thinks this red/blue/green can be turned into gold, and is deferring this transformation.

So 8-5-3 time is really 6D red ice in a star, and it re-enters the earth in 4D plants/animals/humans to finish understanding this transformation to gold.

It’s gold bc it mimics the golden shine of the lost kingdom of Atlantis, sunken by aliens. It was created by this same Red Triangle, her first shine.

Our shine helps recreate that heaven. 

...

As this understanding becomes more and more finalized, the 8-5-3 ice is turned to red/blue/green gas and then a red/blue/green magnetic “gold” shine

## Hard Matter

You could also say this red/blue/green star ice is the matter we see and feel all around us 

The “seeing” decisions are so strong, so decisive, by our star that we are wrapped inside them 

Our 4D threads add to this 6D vision, which also doubles as the feel of everything around us
