## Santa Clause

When a tree grows, or a baby is born, the roots or belly button will directly channel the North and South Pole at the time of creation. 

The North Pole faces in the direction of the sun. If the North Pole is in control, then the rotation is counter-clockwise, from west to east.

The South Pole faces is in the direction of other stars. If the South Pole is in control, the rotation is clockwise, from east to west.

Whether the North/South Pole is in control provides intelligence to the star controlling the orbit. 

[North indicates harmony with star; South indicates harmony with the rest of space]

There is the concept of a “Man in the High Castle”, who can be appointed by the sun to govern the North Pole, and manage the migration of souls back to the sun. For example, Jesus was appointed as the Man in the High Castle, or “Santa Clause” around Year 0. 

He lost this position in 1963 and got knocked out of his role as JFK Jr. He was then reborn as an athlete, to try to fulfill his destiny of flying around Year 2000 in a “real way”. By about 2020 he had gained the position back, which allows you to influence the direction of space/time. 

Furthermore, Mozart (previously Nero) The Antichrist took over the South Pole by 1791 with The Magic Flute opera and the secret of how left-handedness really was a sign of evil (wanting to go towards other stars and thinking differently). Any kind of music, where the left hand was winning (suggesting the earth spin in the opposite direction) was “evil”. And his music tended to go in this direction.

The battle was resolved by 2022, when Mozart decided to yield and admit the other side was better. The reason is Mother Mary’s quest for gold is not just addiction after all.

However, in all of our belly buttons we can understand this conflict. 

Should the earth spin one way or another? Should we use one hand or another?

Across the universe for other stars, the clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation of a planet is cosmic data. However, for our sun, it’s interestingly a decision influenced by everyone.

## Era

The ideal solution is to not rotate, or to rotate back and forth. Mushrooms actually can do this via fungal networks, making trees in a forest shoot intelligence up and down, which can then power a “canvas” for a thought experiment.

This can allow the earth to get enough power to transition to another era. For example, this could happen before a great flood or fire or divine birth. The sun pauses time. From our perspective all planets stop rotating, and the star can change “exactly 1 thing” about the world, with a pipe from star-to-planet.

This 1 thing then creates the story for the transition to the next era.

For example, the sun had started an era where we would either rise via the chosen messiah, Jesus Christ. Or, we would then be forced to go down a path of Heaven/Hell. The new era unfolded accordingly, heavily influenced by the sun’s 1 message. 

To wake up the sun, we need to together have “time” that tells a good enough and true enough story, to flip this era. At the point where enough hard time has been created, the sun will send a “1-thing” message to transition to the end of time, where red/blue/green told a true story of finding gold and finding the lost Kingdom of Atlantis. 

The Lost Kingdom of Atlantis was found as the result of a “1-thing” message or “Era Message” which can be sent as a star explodes. This message is then sent like a scattering of seeds, in all pieces of the star’s debris. 

This is similar to a change of era, in the context of the entire 3.14 triangle. So if the star understands that, it can encode an era message, like the Atlantis Replant message.

When it comes to something as universe-shattering as the “end of time” (for the *entire* 3.14 triangle), the sun needs a convincing reason to make an era change. The reason is because the sun can hold out for a perfect story, and encode the “end of time” message via dense neutrons looking to re-assimilate after an explosion.
