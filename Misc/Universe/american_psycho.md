## American Psycho

Our universe (earth) is believed to have ended once.

The Devil took someone over in the 1970s, and aggressively using marijuana/psychedelics he ended the world prematurely. He loved super-heavy rock concerts, satanic worshipping, and super-bright colors from green products.

From above, The Devil (Banana Man) made one change in plant genetics to steer towards development of marijuana. Marijuana plants (via thc) come up with carbon combinations that always see the color "hot orange". That is the root change.

When carbon combinations look at orange, they always intersect with gold in this universe. This then makes the plants think in circular/non-linear ways.

...

So when The Devil took marijuana in the 1970s, on a more magical earth, he was able to die awake because of the fact that he had initiated the creation of marijuana from above.

By 1990, everyone was one level up in dreams. This included the Jesus reincarnation of the time, who ended up being known as "American Psycho". He had been JFK Jr. (a much much different person), had lived like a movie version of Alexander or Caesar, and was led by The Devil very aggressively to commit crimes. He killed one person during a party, and disposed of the body.

From about 1990 to 2001, The Devil and his "B-side" human heaven rocked out and enjoyed carnal pleasures. However, bc The Devil had not got pi (π) or understood it in any fashion on earth, he was responsible for understanding it in "dreams" before Heaven was finalized. However, in 2001, another group of aliens who didn't like the carnal pleasure of The Devil used super knowledge of π to invade their Heaven and send everyone back to around 1955.

The invasion was during a movie in the dream-world New York, and is said to have been about realistic robots (most like 2001 A.I.)

The previous time after 1955 just never existed, and the earth the second time around is said to have "0 magic", nearly 0, because we fell so low after the 2001 invasion.

When you need to redo time, the way it is held together becomes very conscious/obvious, so magic dissipates.

...

We would look back at American Psycho and say he was "taken over", and also that Jesus got his chance to be Batman and failed.

Also, his life this time around (as a superstar basketball player) is redeeming.

Hence, when we go to Heaven a second time it will not be with the same "rush" as the first time. It is much more conscious, serious, and hopefully without tricks.
