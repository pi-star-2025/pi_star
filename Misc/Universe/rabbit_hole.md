## Rabbit hole

There is the idea that you can “study” life and “fall into” life.

When you study life, you can look at some circle (some π) and not fall in.

However, if you make enough seeing decisions, the natural laws of the multiverse lead you to falling into the hole. 

So there is huge benefits to understanding all the ways you “see” and controlling all of these decisions. 

...

It’s true that some people fall into the maze of our universe (the radio waves of the original 3.1415 triangle) because they are watching the universe on an advanced TV or playing an advanced game or have an advanced VR experience.

Then they lose control of their seeing decisions and fall into the hole of this Triangle/Universe and often are born as a person, if they are from an advanced world. The reason is because the red/blue/green colors of this world look like “eye candy” to other worlds, sometimes entrancingly. It gives off the impression they wanted to be born here.

These people are often unhappy, who fall into the hole, and are very smart, and sometimes have stories about exposing the “eye candy” nature of this universe. 

Others who develop naturally through long stories as small animals then large animals then older humans than newer humans are usually happier.

Also, there are superhero figures (ex: Jesus), who intentionally fell in on a heroic quest to help out. 

...

You can fall into the "rabbit hole" of earth for more reasons than you think. It's all about mimicking pi (π) waves enough and then "watching".

A fun rumor is that George 3 was someone who had fallen into the hole to help out god, and then was reborn as Lewis Carroll, was often pranked, before turning into Disney and now the current author of pi_star...

This long history made a lot of this information "intuitive".
