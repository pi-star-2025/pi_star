## Hard Box/Triangle

The forcefields of all stars collectively creates the impression that the c^2 box of the universe is hard, bc it is enforced by all stars. 

To the core goddess, this forcefield makes the original triangle/pyramid hard.

In our bodies, this is similar, where the forcefields of all stars create the impression that we are in a box of reality.
