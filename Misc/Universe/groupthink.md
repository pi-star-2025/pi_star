## Groupthink

The biggest improvement Mother Earth could make in our red/blue/green world is to understand that in a very hot gassy environment like ours it is very easy for communication to become lost. Between life and god. 

The easiest way then to attack Mother Earth in a gassy environment is to, if you are “evil” (against life/humans), do one thing first as soul -> join a network, keep joining a bigger and bigger network of vision that wants what you want before doing anything else. In a gassy environment, this can have runaway effects and easily create False Gods. 

There are many “dark networks” in the airs of Mother Earth, which have such disintegrated intelligence, they get disguised like code. 

The biggest improvement Mother Earth could make is to look for groupthink. Look for cases of groupthink that mirror the behavior of False Gods. The energy at a gas level is similar to that of locusts, which feed off a collective buzz to create angry music. The musical nature gets social attention, especially in collection.

Technically, this is the root cause of the “Judas Situation”. The social conflicts pervaded the air.
