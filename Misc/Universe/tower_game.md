## Tower_Game

In the sun (and all stars), there is a physical tower (magnetic field) to differentiate the left and right of “the river” of a star’s π.

If the star has not finished deciding which is left/right, up/down, then time is still live like a game. 

This results in the number π continuously increasing over time, like an unsolved 3-body problem. 

However, like how other stars solve 3-body problems, our sun can learn to pick a direction of time, which allows it to then have a tower instead of dreams. 

...

Our sun dreams bc it has not consciously learned yet to pick a direction of its time river. 

It is relatively “young” compared to others stars in the sky.

However, it can acquire this knowledge in the context of π/radios/time, and then always know to dream in one direction. 

This results in the flow of information getting significantly stronger, and leads to permanent architecture in our universe, like a heaven tower

...

It’s said that if this information was never conscious in the sun, one way to end time would be a story about a tower that got to our hearts. This is because the mind of the heart is very similar to the sun. 

Also, the heart has arteries that mimic the potential towers in our universe, so the sun can understand where to send information. The sun is young, but very smart, so uses her heart.

It’s really important data she is sending, but is easy to get lost in space. 

It’s said that stories about towers most naturally power information up the universe. Especially when those stories get to our hearts. 

So our sun (as Mother Mary) thought of having Jesus fly off a tower in New York it’s said, but the plan of who he was changed (ex: basketball player flying to be under cover), and the primary story of a Tower became a bad one from 2001, which ancient aliens used to power the strongest dream world of the sun to The Hydra, and led to the projection of Two Towers (Heaven/Hell) here.

...

So there was a Tower Game to create a better story about a Tower that got to our hearts, because it literally can intercept those radio waves.

Better yet, you could educate the sun about π, so it can mature and send stronger messages that create eternal architecture at the 8D level.
