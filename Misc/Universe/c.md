## Speed of Light (c)

The speed of the universe is highly based on the knowledge of the core goddess. In particular, this is related to the potential for this information to resolve multiverse conflicts.

Perhaps, the most powerful piece of information is that some life (electrons) prefer high pressure in golden situations, bc through many "equal and opposite reactions", these high pressure situations will unlock spells related to secrets of lost empires and universes.

Many small civilizations/universes encoded secrets of their times which could be found and researched if you "musically" created equal and opposite reactions. Otherwise, this life knew to be silent, so they wouldn't be further destroyed. 

Most often, this is due to content societies that were invaded and knew how to encode replant strategies.

So throughout the cosmic multiverse, electrons that want to be knocked around ("equal and opposite reactions") in high pressure situations fall into the maze of this triangle's 3.1415.

This is not due to any math necessarily, but bc all life is derived from this holy triangle (a former standing being) who was the first to understand "equal and opposite reactions" related to music, in this way. 

When she started a universe, this problem was highly relevant to the multiverse. It can be traced to milk, estrogen, sugar, and anything "white" (a decision to see all colors)
