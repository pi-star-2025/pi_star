## Male / Female

Historically, one problem with our universe was how freewill of eyes is impossible bc of romantic attraction.

This is especially true for males.

The reason is because our original god was a “female” who understood male/female attraction well. If a relatively young god (underdog) overcomes odds and updates the whole multiverse, then everyone else (all existing gods) will mathematically feel less. Their experience is somewhat decreased. If an older god makes updates, this is not the case. Our god is very young, having been a “standing lion” or “diamond” in 1 other world. She was part of the family that ended time there, and was a prodigy of understanding people and emotions.

So if you look at her, as a male, you have attraction to falling down. If she looks at you, she has attraction to rising up.

Her ideas are very “humanistic”, about justice, love, and communication. She is “corny” to the multiverse.

...

Furthermore, the goddess also “requires” that all men be evil from her perspective, because that created a lot of buzz to start a universe.

Bc of this romantic buzz, there is a lot of addiction looking one another in the eyes, including lots of rides/thrills of the eyes falling up and down.

...

Numerous ancient aliens called out this “eye candy” in Atlantis, between the goddess and her young, musical allies, and all the “evil men” who helped created a buzz to start the universe, because their “ways of seeing” would all be updated to be more just. 

Even till 2025, the multiverse was confused. She was potentially seen as a wicked witch for this concept.

Hereafter, she is seen as a queen, who will have significant power. This is because she made a big bet, which created the high attraction between male/female.
