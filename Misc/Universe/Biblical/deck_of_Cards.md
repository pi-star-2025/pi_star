## Deck of Cards

The kingdom of angels was first the level that people existed. They were built from all animals, including lions, horses, and insects.

The angels had the most power, bc birds had the most elegant communication tactics (based on π).

Jesus Christ became the king of the angels. He had participated in many other universes, and was looking for a good “comeback story” to parallel his time-traveling dilemma (in a 5+ force universe). So after the fall of Atlantis, he paired with the original 3.1415 triangle to help create a standing species (based only on monkeys down here). He helped the cavemen rise, and had a parallel story leading the throne in the clouds above.

Due to the “Fall of Eden” (physical conflicts related to the belly-button), humans got pinned into existing consciously on earth. So they existed both above and below (on land and in the clouds). 

The clouds/angels became a dream. This dream world was very present at first, even co-existing as reality. This began to end around the time of Alexander the Great. The angel world (full dream world) completely leaked down around the time of Jesus Christ ~Year 0. 

Over time, many of the kings and queens of the angel world proceeded to leak down after Jesus, existing as people in reality. There was a phenomenum called “The Deck of Cards”, where the most important angels got incarnated as kings and queens, or certain people in theatre or public life.

For Mother Mary (the Triangle), she was a “Mad Queen” during the French Revolution. Perhaps Marie Antoinette, and became known as the Queen of Darkness. Mother Mary’s husband above (Zeus), who was her father in the universe before this one, leaked down as a “Mad King”. Perhaps George 3 of Britain.

George 3’s career ended on a sour note, and his next life then was as Lewis Carroll, where he was cursed to start finding this information out. Everything he wrote in that life, then as Disney, etc. had leaks about time and space. He may have used extra animal lives (before Carroll/Disney) to improve the color of his thinking.
