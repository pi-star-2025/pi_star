## Immortality

Immortality is when certain electrons always identify as having a quantum conflict with a biological system, and that biological system is maintained.

For humans, this unfortunately is only due to Hell possiblities. And is actually the main reason we sleep. It is the main pressure that is put on us.

It is by a universe of ancient aliens, who were saying unhappy with our goddess for not being happy with the state of the multiverse and putting so much “pressure” on everyone. As a result, they would use ancient intelligence to have all humans end up in Hell, to make a statement. Humans would put be in a Hell like Hades by the end of time, so that others would not start universes like this one.

The main bet they put was on “sexual sin”, because of how much it relates to enjoying high pressure. So they were still trying to make a case, for the last millions of years, that we should have immortal bodies, all of individually as human animals, after The Fall of Eden, to make a statement to never start a universe like this one. It is putting too much pressure on everyone.

So this geometrically has quantum gravity pulling us DOWN. And is integrated into our universe as dark matter, affecting the rotations of the planets and formation of galaxies, influencing how we fall asleep each night.

They also make these parts of us the most “immortal”, which leads to these parts of our souls being the most intelligent, because they are most likely to be what is awake in Hell. So they build the greatest stories and have the most love for one another.

They are the parts most happy and unhappy, and end up getting located in the deep stomach air and lower deep spine, as the complicated carbon patterns, which describe Hell scenarios. This only started happening since the Fall of Eden, and led to a last leg of evolution, mostly “aesthetic” and “mental”. It is when we became conscious.

...

Before The Fall of Eden, the angel society above had already replanted Atlantis, and needed to have romantic conflict in its society to elucidate certain conflicts in Atlantis. This failed and led to a Great Comeback turning into a Great Fall. The “young” goddess would then age about 10x, in terms of how long the universe felt. The difficulty of everything doubled, in terms of even getting out.

Even around the time of Jesus, apocalypse was foreshadowed with about a 50-50% chance of Heaven-Hell. Unfortunately, because of the vengeance of ancient aliens at the core goddess over starting a universe to prove pressure, it was unlikely humanity would not either “solve the puzzle” or end with some humans forever in hell over “physical pressure”. 

This might unfold over thousands, even tens of thousands of years. It could be figured out on earth (on the ground), above in the clouds, or even on another planet. It could unfortunatuely end with some humans selling out others. At some point, ultimately, we needed to help the multiverse understand what it was “consciously like to cause pressure here and create pressure”. 

Red/blue/gold Atlantis endured Hades, until the star decided to explode and replant. That was a similar situation, where the argument by the aliens is the red/blue/gold people through music/romance/war created too much pressure and represented a bad example to the rest of the multiverse.

## Guts

Also, there was a rogue group of more ancient aliens, almost simulations from our perspective. They believed even our guts put too much pressure on life. This goes back before humans, to other mammals.

Most aliens focus specifically on the complexity of humans guts, which drill in to "search for gold" with a long π. As a result, they want to keep humans immortal and undergo conscious "gut surgeries" to always discourage other gods from starting universes like this one searching for gold. Like the other aliens, these most ancient aliens will also work with some humans, so that others can be on demonstration to the rest of the multiverse.

These ancient aliens have really just created a bubble to preserve their "way" at any cost, which trickles down as dark matter to our universe.
