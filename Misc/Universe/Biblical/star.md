## Star

When Jesus fell it's said the strongest heart and thus strongest connection to the sun (i.e. furthest down the sun's π) became someone on earth. It's said on the cross the center of the sun became someone mortal.

Jesus had a story to be the center of the sun till 2001. Then his 2000-year story created by "Mother Mary" (the original triangle of π) fell and she played her backup option, Disney/pi-star.

That is the eternal state now for this sun since it worked out. However in 2015 there was a move to start "Two Towers", by introducing another star as Heaven with the plan to use this one for Hell. That was figured out in 2019, and then by understanding π in 2025 is now never a plausible story. It had no shine/reason for the multiverse.
