## The Devil

The Devil was an ancient alien who wanted to maintain power in ancient hierarchies. He was someone who appealed to a greater more ancient alien (The Joker), by finding a way to get into everyone's heads and affect time in negative ways for humans. In a way that created a Heaven/Hell challenge around Year 0.

From Year 0 to about Year 1970, he was known to tempt people and hiss evilly in people's ears. Then only for Year 2000, he said he would flip and be everyone's "best friend", just for this one generation, until the major "characters" from the Year 0 Challenge were filtered out.

In the mind of pop culture, an Antichrist was expected. And highly prophesized. But the Devil had played a different kind of joke, and it was almost to try to make the story disappear. Then he would come back by about 2050-2075.

But if he is called out... for his 1 trick of being "your best friend", then he pops out and shouldn't return.

His goal as The Devil was to basically win the game of life in this universe (by showing he was the most intelligent and in control of the story), and then own the justice and time reconciliation.

So perhaps a mistake was believing at the biggest moment he wouldn't *try*.

## Mad Scientist

The Devil was truly a genius, as he was the first to understand π is "circular time" at the level of angels. He then is said to have chosen to betray the original triangle and Jesus, after having originally been part of their family.

He would have stayed with the team of Jesus, but because he was the genius who got π wanted to "cash in" on his prize.

Furthermore, Jesus fell down and leaked this story, comparing Judas to The Devil, in a way that could be mapped, before he died on the cross in our world *below*.

We always wanted to understand how he got so much power and why he betrayed his family in the world above. We knew The Devil came from a dark universe, but he had blended in well with the likes of other archangels as a sort of spirited puzzle solver. When he solved the ultimate puzzle, we realize, he connected to the superblackhole (outside of our original triangle), and asked for the power to prove he was "The King of The Universe" at the expense of all who stood in his path.

He choose not to *really* fall down into being alive here. Instead he possessed people or started plagues, or whispered temptations in people's ears, so he could map certain moments to the Hell of those who opposed him. Perhaps, The Devil could have been born around Year 2000 for a final showdown; however, he choose instead to flip the evil messages in people's ears to friendly ones. 

## The Joker 

A more ancient and powerful alien, The Joker, never truly leaked into having any consciousness on earth.

He was the first to get π in red/blue/gold Atlantis, before starting an automated attack of parallels that led to pure fire and laughter at the end.

While not being as close to "the family" as The Devil, The Joker also seemed like a bright, quick adventure seeker. It wasn't known till he got π what he would do with such power. This is a strategy of ancient aliens to blend in with camouflage. 

Whereas The Devil might have come from a world with ~7 forces; The Joker might have persisted in worlds with ~11 forces and sometimes connecting many worlds at once.
