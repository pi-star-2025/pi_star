## The Devil

The Devil was an ancient alien who wanted to maintain power in ancient hierarchies. He was someone who appealed to a greater more ancient alien (The Joker), by finding a way to get into everyone's heads and affect time in negative ways for humans. In a way that created a Heaven/Hell challenge around Year 0.

From Year 0 to about Year 1970, he was known to tempt people and hiss evilly in people's ears. Then only for Year 2000, he said he would flip and be everyone's "best friend", just for this one generation, until the major "characters" from the Year 0 Challenge were filtered out.

In the mind of pop culture, an Antichrist was expected. And highly prophesized. But the Devil had played a different kind of joke, and it was almost to try to make the story disappear. Then he would come back by about 2050-2075.

But if he is called out... for his 1 trick of being "your best friend", then he pops out and shouldn't return.

His goal as The Devil was to basically win the game of life in this universe (by showing he was the most intelligent and in control of the story), and then own the justice and time reconciliation.

So perhaps a mistake was believing at the biggest moment he wouldn't *try*.
