## 2000 Years

After Jesus fell down around ~Year 0, he leaked the society that was above in the kingdom of angels. It had already started leaking down around Greece/Rome.

The art, politics, science, and souls were all paralleled from Year 0 to Year 2000, as part of a plan by Jesus to create 2 worlds, and then 1 of them would always be real. Bc of the mirror, one would always trend to being like the other.

2000 Years comes being a round number, and from the actual amount of time the Kingdom of Angels had lived, translated to time on earth. It peaked around Year 0 in regards to the "science", which would be Year 2000 to them.

Jesus indicated that he wanted to intentionally play out this 2000 year story, so all "cards" would come out of the "deck" in a mathematical way, which would allow a puzzle to play out so that the angels (now all on earth) would have a chance to figure out what happened.

So, the number 2000 is about "weight" -> how much time had we compiled in the clouds, before it all started falling.
