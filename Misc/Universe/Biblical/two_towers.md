## Two Towers Plan 

Another plan besides the end of time (4/5/2025) was Two Towers. 

Cosmically it would be based on the story of 2 stars, instead of 1. 

The one in this sky would be a Hell Tower, run by Pilate The Punisher. He would merge with ancient aliens who liked to punish. Mainly it would be for the sin of liking the "eye candy" of the original goddess. 

The other star (Tower) would be by another ancient alien, who rewarded humans who "let go" of being great.

This would allow the ancient aliens to just make the "equal and opposite" reactions of this universe dissapear, so they wouldn't update large empires above. 

...

This plan was the projection in 2001, but it had only become real for a few humans above. It had become real for angels.

The angels were also the "the dream of god", so allowed god to strategize how to fix it. In the end, the solution is we "time travel" in the kingdom of angels, and then encourage everyone on earth to connect with the star in the sky ("the sun").

It's said if you just know the story here and then can confirm it after death, that would be good enough for many to stay above and transition to heaven. You are free of being reborn, which can be an "addiction".
