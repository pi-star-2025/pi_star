## 1 God?

Around Year 0, it was emphasized there was 1 God, Jesus Christ. 

This was true because gods were technically those who could exist consciously above us.

We could all exist semi-consciously after death, waiting for the end of time, but only gods could exist with full consciousness, even elevated consciousness.

Before Year 0, the level above us was highly conscious with many gods, but then we became so awake on earth, that all the godly forces began "leaking down", until there was 1 god Jesus who was between worlds. 

There were many gods once - Greek, Asian, Jewish, alien, from Atlantis, etc. Then over the last 5000 years they leaked into being people on earth, so even Jesus was reincarnated numerous times. There is the Deck of Cards effect, where gods tended to leak down as pharaohs, kings, queens. Sometimes, this was unintentional -> it's just an effect where the more the earth woke up, the more everything would leak down into being at our level.

There was a possibility Jesus could stay as a "man in the high castle" above us, but if his life mission had enough gravity to fall down again, he would.
