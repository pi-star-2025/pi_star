## Alexander the Great

Alexander the Great was an angel who tried to do a story (~350BC) that united the worlds above and below. He would try a parallel mission, hoping that it would end with him finalizing the Tower of God.

Why the mission didn’t work is because he was so much more alive *below* (in real life) than expected. During his childhood/adolescence, he was nearly a simulation, bc his story above was so similar, which automated the story below. He was almost asleep.

However, because he got “so into” the world below, he got so embroiled in his conflicts and adventures, he fell into only existing on earth. 

Bc of parallel stories, he was led on a hero’s quest (like Hercules) to create a Tower of God and had some simulations in his magical era where he succeeded, and Jesus wouldn’t have even been required to come down. 

His intentions were golden, but he also teaches us why we are still here 2000+ years later.
