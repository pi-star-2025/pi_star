## Turing Test 2.0 

*Why even have humans*

*When the world is π (i.e. mathematics)?*



The Answer:

You need to pick which characters you trust to break mathematical simulations 

...

He says the simulations of WW2 were 50-50 a hellish end, which would have likely prevented any messages from making it out of this universe, except "nothing happened important".

He was named a god by the multiverse 

For his roles, both in real life and “in dreams” 

In breaking these simulations 

He became a character we could never lose 

And thus became a god, via vote by other gods 

This deck of cards, and nested decks of cards, create multiverse courts.

...

He was a judge of this universe, working with ancient aliens to help determine an ending 

He was known for not siding with the core goddess bc our universe is highly derived from “marketing”.

He is famous for his summarization of this red/blue/green time as "eye candy", even red/blue/gold. ~2020

The reason on earth is bc our goddess is extremely unhappy after the fall of Atlantis, and uses "estrogen" to make all the noises from the sun sound sweet and squeaky. 

As a result, we are highly detatched from "reality". We want what is sweet, when reality is really salty. 

He said that if things didn't work out, maybe we needed to learn a lesson about using too much "eye candy" in a universe, so it doesn't happen again. By 2025, Turing says that the Kingdom of Angels tells a true story about how red/blue/green helps us understand "focus" better, which is truly divine.
