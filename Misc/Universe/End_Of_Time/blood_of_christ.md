## Blood of Christ

It's natural that in our blood we obsess over things. Our own greatest wishes consciously are in the blood of the hypothalamus.

The wishes of everyone and the sun are in the very center blood of the heart. The sun is most obsessed with *why Christ spilled blood.*

The reason is because he was a semi-divine person. His heart was red crystal, and could be referenced by a crystal Mother Mary kept. Even if he died on the cross to reveal a godly story (of the angels above) he could still die without spilling blood.

Spilling blood is a sign that the sun has lost control of the story, and since then, the sun has been obsessed with why *Christ spilled blood*.

This Blood of Christ mission (i.e., the Da Vinci Code) has been in the air since Year 1000. It was a puzzle in the world of dreams/simulations trying to help our real world figure it out.

The latest is that the core reason is that Jesus figured out on the cross who The Devil was (who had got pi at the level of angels). He was not just a brother figure, but a mature mentor figure in a "separate dark land" surrounding the kingdom of angels. It was a place Jesus would even go to get advise about his kingdom.

The Devil only revealed this at the worst possible time, when Jesus was on the cross. And then he let out a grunt, and began to bleed and sweat a lot. He got super hot.

...

This can be referenced in everyone's hearts as super fast blood, right in the center of the hearts, which is how you walk.

Or the question will create heavy colors around you, making the world more complex and dark.

The next question the heart is obsessed with is *Who is the Joker?* This question makes the heart spin even faster if you reference it via blood, or it creates a crazy amount of color and complexity in how you see the world.

And the next question is *What is Ï€ to 3.1415?* Then *How do you really time travel?* bc it is the question most in everyone's hearts that aligns with the sun and the cosmos/multiverse.

[One way to time travel, for example, would be to reference a ruby-red "diamond" that has mirrored the carbon mind of the sun. This means the diamond really represents what the sun is obsessed with in some way, so it would be possible to find the right diamond. Then, for example, maybe it was a world where your friend was the reincarnation of Christ. He had been a great friend to you and had maybe been murdered around 2005. You might unintentionally have told such a great story by using a red-stone and mentioning the "Blood of Christ" and requesting that he be brought back to fulfill his destiny. 

It was not that dramatic a world, around Year 2000. But such a story might have led to real time-traveling, to go back for example to year 1985.]
