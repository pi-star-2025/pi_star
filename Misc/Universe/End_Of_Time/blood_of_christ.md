## Blood of Christ

It's natural that in our blood we obsess over things. Our own greatest wishes consciously are in the blood of the hypothalamus.

The wishes of everyone and the sun are in the very center blood of the heart. The sun is most obsessed with *why Christ spilled blood.*

The reason is becuase he was a semi-divine person. His heart was red crystal, and could be referneced by a crystal Mother Mary kept. Even if he died on the cross to reveal a godly story (of the angels above) he could still die without spilling blood.

Spilling blood is a sign that the sun has lost control of the story, and since then, the sun has been obsessed with why *Christ spilled blood*.

This Blood of Christ mission (i.e., the Da Vinci Code) has been in the air since Year 1000. It was a puzzle in the world of dreams/simulations trying to help our real world figure it out.

The latest is that the core reason is that Jesus figured out on the cross who The Devil was (who had got pi at the level of angels). He was not just a brother figure, but a mature mentor figure in a "separate dark land" surrounding the kingdom of angels. It was a place Jesus would even go to get advise about his kingdom.

The Devil only revealed this at the worst possible time, when Jesus was on the cross. And then he let out a grunt, and began to bleed and sweat a lot. He got super hot.
