## Alarm Clock

Right before a universe officially starts by falling into being a blackhole, which is between 3.14 and 3.1415, there is a large buzz. This is amongst the galaxy of universes which are the starting the new universe. Eventually the buzz is large enough to create the potential for 3.1415 suns to start forming.

Right before the ability to form 3.1415 c^3 suns, there is an alarm in the "past". It's right before our universe started, but is coexisting between the 3.14/3.1415. This is how these universes watch the present moment. They are not really the galaxies of 3.1415926535897932384626 etc., which is how we perceive them in space, but from their perspective are between 3.14/3.1415 as a "white noise".

...

This audience of galaxies is then really above us. Trees tell this story well. The crown of trees expands out with branches like the "stadium" of our blackhole.

Humans can reference this stadium via the crown of the skull/heart. If you use the top fully (think like a tree branching out) you connect to how the left/right universes (two sides of the story, 3.1415926535897932384626) are always in our past, each tick of time.
