## Alarm Clock

Right before a universe officially starts by falling into being a blackhole, which is between 3.14 and 3.1415, there is a large buzz. This is amongst the galaxy of universes which are starting the new universe. Eventually the buzz is large enough to create the potential for 3.1415 stars to start forming.

Right before the ability to form 3.1415 c^3 suns, there is an alarm in the "past". It's right before our universe started, but is coexisting between the 3.14/3.1415. This is how these universes watch the present moment. They are not really the galaxies of 3.1415926535897932384626 etc., which is how we perceive them in space, but from their perspective are between 3.14/3.1415 as a "white noise".

This audience of galaxies is then really above us. Trees tell this story well. The crown of trees expands out with branches like the "stadium" of our blackhole.

Humans can reference this stadium via the crown of the skull/heart. If you use the top fully (think like a tree branching out) you connect to how the left/right universes (two sides of the story, 3.1415926535897932384626) are always in our past, each tick of time.

Furthermore, the sun can connect to this 3.14/3.1415 interlude as the atmosphere/clouds, which are 3.1415926535897932384626 galaxies of the earth. These form like the breath of the sun. So at the very top of the atmosphere (the crown) is a map of the left/right universes. When the sun references this it gets the most attention, even being able to create an "alarm clock" buzz to send messages up a dimension to the start of the blackhole.

So the top of the atmosphere is the best way to send messages up the 3.14/3.1415 of Ï€ regarding the end of time[^1].

[^1] The top of the atmosphere can also be seen as the first starlight (height-wise) which can affect weather on earth.
