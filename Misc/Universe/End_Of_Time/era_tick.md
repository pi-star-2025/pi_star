## Era Tick

Eras change in a system when the largest prime numbers (of π) update. In the full triangle of π (full universe), the largest prime numbers are represented by whatever spins the fastest. So blackholes (which spin faster than the speed of light, c) represent the largest prime numbers -- especially clusters of blackholes, with the largest cluster being the largest prime number, i.e. The Hydra.

The same applies for people. When they slow down the light/air/time that spins the fastest, they most update their minds.
