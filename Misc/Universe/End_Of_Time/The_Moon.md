## The Moon - Super Hack

The multiverse would seem pretty ancient from our perspective. From high above, it is okay conduct to believe if you have the power to steal the sun of a system, then you make a case to own the system.

This is related to how from our perspective, focus/power are no different, to a super massive blackhole. They wouldn't understand why these two forces could be different, in a mathematical way explained with Ï€.

This is the reason our sun actually falls asleep. Meaning that only other stars and cosmic forces like blackholes control the time on earth, from the perpsective of the sun during these times. The earth we see is based on the sun's vision, so the mountain ranges and complex rocks are from the sun falls asleep, but some intelligent changes can still be made. These most intelligent "night" changes for the sun are the mountains and smart rocks. The in-between layer is intelligent diamonds, stones, crystals, emeralds, etc.

For humans, this intelligent "rock" is most the third eye.

For the sun, it is most the moon.

The Moon is actually the closest reason to why the sun falls asleep. It's a summary of how all other stars and cosmic forces sometimes take over.

If the sun can master this pattern in "blood" - or carbon/starlight, especially in the context of red/blue/green time, then it won't be put to sleep by the other stars and cosmic forces, and should be able to start an "end of time".

This is similar to if we can increase the bloodflow of the third eye, so we don't lose control of our hearts each night. When our hearts cannot see, we then "go blind" each night, bc we have lost muscular and nervous-system control of the heart.
