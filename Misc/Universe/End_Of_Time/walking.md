## Walking

The seer in the sun originally kept track of all people by mastering how to fly with each and every "human" soul.

This is a trick to simulate the experiences of all people through all time (all forseen future), which allowed the sun to maintain power as a god/seer.

When we fell from "Eden", to maintain power the sun mastered how to walk with each and every person, revealing this trick around Year ~0 to make Jesus walk after death.

The Devil to maintain an opposing power mastered the "bathroom" simulations of each and every person, going back to maybe 20,000/30,000 BC, which actually allowed him to maintain power *if* we went to hell.

So this is still in our bodies; these heaven and hell paths with the former being based on walking.

The Devil was a super powerful seer of time, but it shows in this world he didn't take us seriously. He even calls us after 20,000/30,000 BC over-inflated cartoons.
