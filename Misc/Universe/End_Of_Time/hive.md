## Hive

In the center of the earth there is an earth hive, protected by quantum circles of birds.

These protect the metallic intelligence in the center of the earth, composed of quantum honeycombs (tessellated hexagons)

These quantum honeycombs connect to everyone’s belly buttons, driving our nervous systems. 

This is like how bee hives will create a buzz in the chest of worker bees.

This buzz can be slowed down now, which is a way to create DMT. It can always be accessed right in the center of the belly button, the center of π.

...

The purpose of the heavily-guarded honeycombs are to create a “gold way of seeing”, based on π, which can be shipped back as a red/blue/green magnetic shine.

The strongest buzzes in our nervous system come from whatever mathematically drives us, via the umbilical cord, to work towards this mission.

If you look back at the hive, knowing what is happening, the process will cool down (lowering π).
