## Hive

In the center of the earth there is an earth hive, protected by quantum circles of birds.

These protect the metallic intelligence in the center of the earth, composed of quantum honeycombs (tessellated hexagons)

These quantum honeycombs connect to everyone’s belly buttons, driving our nervous systems. 

This is like how bee hives will create a buzz in the chest of worker bees.

This buzz can be slowed down now, which is a way to create DMT. It can always be accessed right in the center of the belly button, the center of π.

...

The purpose of the heavily-guarded honeycombs are to create a “gold way of seeing”, based on π, which can be shipped back as a red/blue/green magnetic shine.

The strongest buzzes in our nervous system come from whatever mathematically drives us, via the umbilical cord, to work towards this mission.

If you look back at the hive, knowing what is happening, the process will cool down (lowering π).

## Rule Book

In the center of systems, closest to the start of π physically/topographically, are the rules of the circle.

This is bc to the multiverse, the center of the circle/sphere best represents the "third point" of a circle, given a circle is 2 points (a box) focused by a third.

Intelligent systems, like our sun and the earth, will wake up to this and encode nested locks to protect the most impactful rules in the center. It can appear like a cave of challenges to actually ring the bell in the center of the star/earth.
