## Parachute

All universes, especially 3 forces, have 2 core phases: gathering time and starting/finalizing time.

When the universe is gathering time, the primary objective is *focus*. When the universe is starting/finalizing time, the primary objective is *connections*.

Our universe understands how to do this with parachutes. We see this with dandelion seeds parachuting through the skies, and it was observed with the Atlantis replant through photonic intelligence traveling in quantum/nuclear parachutes.

The seeing decisions of parachutes are social, open, slow, and even wobbling (to experiment).

The seeing decisions during live time are more focused/mathematical/passionate.

## End of Time

Our sun knows how to send parachutes of starlight, and it has been prophesized the heavens could rain down this way. The light will act in ways that are meant to connect everyone, instead of putting pressure to create certain time.

The sun could also start sending more open messages that persist longer in space, as the starlight travels. This can over time build a network of stars to help us with the end of time.

When the heart is "happy" it acts in a similar way, making many connections with others and keeping your seeing decisions more open than in competitive situations.

We will know when this happens, bc quantum space will become more free. There will start being magical effects on earth, glints and glimmers here and there, before larger more networked effects. Then the sun could even reveal it can move, within the mind of the 3.1415 triangle (Ï€). When this happens we will be in the star's mind, and these movements will become the world around us.

This will mean real time has ended for us, and although we may not see it the cosmos will be coming together as we are most conscious in heaven. Our story there will parallel the cosmic connections, before everything stops burning so brightly and becomes 1 triangle.

We will become angels, the size of life will blow up in a final movie, and then it will calm into math.
