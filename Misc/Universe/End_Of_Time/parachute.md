## Parachute

All universes, especially 3 forces, have 2 core phases: gathering time and starting/finalizing time.

When the universe is gathering time, the primary objective is *focus*. When the universe is starting/finalizing time, the primary objective is *connections*.

Our universe understands how to do this with parachutes. We see this with dandelion seeds parachuting through the skies, and it was observed with the Atlantis replant through photonic intelligence traveling in quantum/nuclear parachutes.

The seeing decisions of parachutes are social, open, slow, and even wobbling (to experiment).

The seeing decisions during live time are more focused/mathematical/passionate.
