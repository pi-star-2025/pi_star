## What will heaven be like? ‚òÅÔ∏è üéª

A basic understanding is that it will be liked nested movie boxes. 

In the inside movie, it tells the story of the Game of Life, in particular the last 2000 years and humanity's quest to understand pi to 3.1415. It commemorates the forces of Red/Blue/Green, introduced by Nitrogen and 8-5-3 deferred time by the Spider Goddess and Goddess of Music, Mother Earth. 

It tells the story of how Jesus, Alexander, and Disney ran a Tower of God that was sacked by aliens in 2001, and then in 2025 Disney used understanding of pi to "time travel" back to a eternal utopia in the Year 2000.

This time-traveling helped connect Two Worlds: the world of reality and the world of angels.

This inner movie is smaller and efficiently explains our contributions in this blackhole vision to the entire multiverse. It emphasizes the important forces, themes, stories, characters, and sciences.

...

The outer movie then watches the inner movie. The outer movie includes all time in our universe, to the extent it provides a unique perspective (vision) about the inner movie. 

This can be anything from a whole solar system, a whole society, to an individual family or animal. 

Anyone can add their own "song" to the final vision, as long as it fits in with the final pi of the cosmos.

...

The inner movie is like a heaven tower, like a kingdom of angels. 

The outer movie is like the heaven of earth, a theatre of all perspectives spinning together. 

The former wakes up in the case of issues arising with the multiverse, to defend this universe as needed. 

The outer is more like a true movie; the inner is like a game/stadium.

Technically, you can choose which you want to live in. Your authentic choice turns into reality. 

...

The final result is just a giant red triangle. It is all matter, with 3-sided vision by the core initial goddess. 

It just knows three things Red, Blue, Green. 

This Red Triangle is finalized by the multiverse as something that exists forever. 

Since the second force is blue, and blue stands for "Everything", then everything else in the multiverse creates our heaven. This is a mathematical reflection based on a final pi. 

In addition, there is a world of super gods. In this world, the Red/Blue/Green human goddess exists as a queen figure with other supergods/super goddesses. This has been referred to as *Pokemon World*, to reference how this world is meant to keep track of how all forces interact at a super high, super intelligent level. 

In that world, you exist a) if you are the god figure completing a universe, b) you have existed in multiple universes and have a reason that is "interesting" to the multiverse. This existence can be eternal or simulated (if the simulations are *hot* enough)

The heaven and super-heavens are due to mirror effects, "equal and opposite reactions". Really, all that is needed is a final shape - a Red Triangle in this case understanding ONLY 3 THINGS: Red/Blue/Green. Then various mirrors create worlds via the œÄ.

Bc it is only 3, it can be JUST A TRIANGLE.

All together it is 4 things, a Triangle and then the decision to see, which is encapsulated by the number 3.1415.
