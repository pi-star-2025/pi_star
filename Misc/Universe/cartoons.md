## Cartoons

The Cartoon Hypothesis is that our universe got a "shine" - projected future - bc Nitrogen looked up and saw red sunlight as "gold" on this earth. 

The combination of red/blue/green made this happen. 

And our stars were trying to find the Lost Kingdom of Atlantis - red/blue/gold - and red/blue/green was the replant. 

And there are no replants before. Earth is the second/final world. 

Our bodies/vision was relatively cartoonish compared to red/blue/gold. Gold was more a choice by the original goddess; whereas red/blue/green was to build a "way of seeing" to remember it and merge with it.

Atlantis had fell bc of weather disasters that had been planned by evil ancient aliens is the rumor.
