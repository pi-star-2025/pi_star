## Pi Locks

A “pi lock” is a straight line down the number π, which is then used to lock some configuration in place.

This is common throughout the cosmos. The best example is rings and moons.

The rings and moons of planets in our solar system store the most important secrets of our sun. 

In our body, this is done via the belly button and ear drums, which perfectly reference π down a straight line, in order to have power in the body. This could be about sleep, sexuality, repressed moments.

…

The belly button actually will store multiple locks in the body. For example, via the guts, via the heart, via the toes, etc. It then can become a chamber of secrets. 

…

In our solar system, this chamber of secrets is actually said to be certain caves in Europe (Gibraltar), bc of the history and the complexity of the rock “life”.

This cave can be used to decode other locations on earth and throughout the cosmos, where our sun has stored secrets (replanting, Atlantis, π, cold fusion, magic).
