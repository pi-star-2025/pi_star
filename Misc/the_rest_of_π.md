## The Rest of π

What is the rest of π after 3.141592?

It is actually the process from The Big Bang (Hydra) to create atoms via blue/red, which is before the speed of c, to the speed of c. 

Theoretically there is an array in the c^2 mirror creating a circle. This c^3 vector is described by 3.141592. 

Following 3.141592 is the process to turn this array and box into actual physical matter (3D printing) via the quantum lifecycle from the Big Bang to the speed of c. 

After this process, the particular “way of seeing” of your galaxy, star, and observer will be described by the end of the number.

How could the fall of a number create atoms? 

The fall of the universe (from the Big Bang to "real" 4D time) also describes the process of creating atoms. 

π works the same way, by expanding smaller shapes into larger ones with very precise “vision” choices. 

The vision choices earlier are more important (thus the start of the number/universe is “brighter”). 

The vision choices further down are more independent and complex.

If we were to factor out the quantum lifecycle from π, we can isolate the “red/blue/green” choices of our star.

[It should be noted that embedded in π are also adjustments of the 0-9 number system and how it relates to the speed of light]
