## Star Vision

The world is composed of circles in a way. Like planets, atoms, life (red/blue/green).

And decisions to see keep these circles together. 

The heart makes a constant supply of very strong decisions to see, which keep our waking bodies together. 

The star makes a constant supply of very strong decisions to see (long wavelengths), which help keep the cosmos together. 

Technically, our vision is based on these long wavelengths from the star. So everything we see around us (at the 4D level of time) is really star vision. 

—— whereas 3D reality is based on the red/blue c^2 mirror ——

So in a way, our reality is wrapped by the reality of the star.

…

At times we have been in 1 conscious “thought” of the star in our solar system. During magical times.

Other times, it’s been “real” time, where the star is trying to figure out exactly what is going on. 

Due to alien curses the star had become disintegrated in its understanding. 

On 4/5/2025, we entered 1 thought for the star (and also 1 thought for the universe).
