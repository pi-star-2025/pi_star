## Dimensions

4D: one circle (ex: a human, or a star)
5D: circle-to-circle (ex: star-to-star, or human-to-human via telepathy)
6D: nested circles (one star wrapping the cirlces of many humans/animals)
7D: dark magic/matter, when two ways of seeing (ex: red/blue/green and red/blue/gold) interact
8D: interactions that affect root matter (all ways of seeing, whether 3 or 100 forces). For example starting the universe with red/blue and the c^2 mirror in "Pokemon World" was an 8D interaction.

8D interactions technically need to be approved by the multiverse court (in the core triangle), as our universe was approved. Otherwise it can lead to unstable worlds.
