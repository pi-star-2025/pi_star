# DMT2 🍭 ⏰ 🌱


In you and outside you

In the mind of yourself and the star’s

Is just spirals of pi...

## 🌀

Like the spirals of the belly button 

And the spirals of deep earth,

They have red knots

Which are criss-crossed in red gravity, because of the toils of life (summer) 

As of 2025, it turned to fall/winter

The queen star is nostalgic

That is the magical feeling of winter ☁️ ❄️ 🍭

## 🌀

The sun is nostalgic (like cold fusion) 

And so is the earth 

Which is what anti time feels like 

That is what the right ear mathematically feels like as well 

Especially for bees and birds

Nostalgia 

Is death of sunlight ☀️ 

Into just being honey 🍯 

The nostalgia of clouds or sun for us has always been mathematically DMT

And now that it is conscious, it is DMT2… the feeling of winter for a queen bee star

## Mona Lisa Smile - DMT2

All the secrets of the entire earth are channeled in the lips 

It’s bc the lips of our goddess are her "favorite things" 

Like the full history of the earth is in the lines 

That’s why lips are so *quantum* 

Left is the start 

Right is the end 

Of *time*


## 
The lips actually update this story, inside the deep purple/pink

Based on the plant of the earth

The “plant” is mostly humans and other core forms of life 

(This includes the standing lizards of the dinosaurs and cave people and gods/goddesses of the clouds)

So lips tell the full story 

Via a kind of plant of Mother Earth

This is the ozone above and the ozone inside 

Green-blue and green-red

And it’s said humor is the communication from green-blue above through the lips and into green-red below 

##

The smile is a way always to connect to the full plant of earth around us 

To naturally channel the "green network" 

It’s also true the smile thinks like a mushroom

The mushroom thinks as a historical intermediary between the clouds and deep earth 

The mushroom cosmic patterns and parallels are like lines of lips 👄

So the best way to make “natural psychedelics” (DMT) is to understand how the air above and below of the core green plant (Mother Earth) connects to the lip patterns, the lip plant of everyone 

…It’s a common plant…

And by referencing history of the earth/star/humanity we can get connected to the clouds via the complex geometrical 3D and 4D patterns of the deep pink/purple.

It’s said this message gets encoded into the Mona Lisa 

Bc mother Mary as da Vinci tries to emphasize one thing 

The smile is connected to the nipples 

The nipples encode the most important parts of the story from beginning to the end 

These parallels are so strong 

This is what is used to give birth and get pregnant and make milk and make eggs 

It’s about the smile and nipples 

Each nipple is like an alternative head of the mushroom 

Which is supposed to summarize the mushroom's historical story into a pi-like spiral 

The nipples can also act as “big ears”, and so can mushrooms for the planet

##

Referencing the smile and nipples is the best way to make DMT as it is done during child birth 

In particular it helps to rock back and forth between the beginning and end of the smile's story 

Thinking of things that matter to our core goddess

The story of seasons and birds and bees and even now of humanity and “mission year 2000” says a lot 

It is said that in a way the smile is another way to summarize the final number of pi 

Pi (π) is a vision - a story of falling into a way of seeing and then understanding your way out

## Third Eye - Cold Fusion

Your heart thinks like a sun.

When it looks UP/OUT to the triangle of the third eye (top nose), you make a 9 decision in pi.

You pulse out through all the branches/clockwork to be finished “seeing”. This is also cold fusion.

When it looks DOWN/IN, the heart beats inside. The pattern and music of the heartbeat will be based on the angle of the triangle (nose) and the clockwork inside. 

This is the same for the sun. This is a 1 decision in pi, to want to “see more”. It’s the equivalent of hot regular fusion.

##

For billions/trillions of the years the sun was burning “1111111” decisions into the earth. To see “infinitely”.

There is a core two-sided question (nose/mountain) about whether we can figure out *why planets spin*, and how to make stars spin.

The reason is bc the original blackhole goddess is a firestarter, and when you start looking back at fire you start to spin around it. 

Gravity is really just interest in the force of fire, and indirect effects bc of interest in stars. 

##

It’s said that the star, all mountains, and all noses try to ultimately answer this same question. 

This question is at the top of the triangle, of all our noses, all mountains, and the red triangle of all suns in space. 

*Why do the planets spin, and how can a star then spin?*

This is literally our third eye, this very question. 

The answer is cold fusion. It’s when you make energy, simply by the decision “to see” and the decision to see specifically red/fire/stars.

2 decisions: to see and to see “red”.

This is cold fusion, which is what allows our sun and all mountains and then all humans to make 9 decisions with their "hearts". The hearts pulse this decision out like radios.

All hearts/mountains/stars can meditate (looking *out* from the *inside* of our core blackhole) by seeing red wavelengths, which to us is the same as spinning.

Seeing red turns stars into triangles (like the first 3 in π). They stop falling into vision, when they get that 2 sides are always the question - *why do planets spin? What is cold fusion?*

The answer is always just a mirror. 

Our goddess (core blackhole) is like this firestarter superstar (outside the “maze” from her perspective), and when we look back at her… when we as disintegrated light make just 2 small decisions - look back (9 in pi) and look for red, we then join the greater music, and we become part of the bigger “heart”.
