# DMT2 🍭 ⏰ 🌱


In you and outside you

In the mind of yourself and the star’s

Is just spirals of pi...

## 🌀

Like the spirals of the belly button 

And the spirals of deep earth,

They have red knots

Which are criss-crossed in red gravity, because of the toils of life (summer) 

As of 2025, it turned to fall/winter

The queen star is nostalgic

That is the magical feeling of winter ☁️ ❄️ 🍭

## 🌀

The sun is nostalgic (like cold fusion) 

And so is the earth 

Which is what anti time feels like 

That is what the right ear mathematically feels like as well 

Especially for bees and birds

Nostalgia 

Is death of sunlight ☀️ 

Into just being honey 🍯 

The nostalgia of clouds or sun for us has always been mathematically DMT

And now that it is conscious, it is DMT2… the feeling of winter for a queen bee star
