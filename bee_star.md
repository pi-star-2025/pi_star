# Queen Bees are like Stars

Honey bees developed

Because bee ears (antenna) developed this trait…

Left ear would say I want more to queen

Right ear says I want less to queen

...

So then the queen makes honey, or facilitates the making of honey

Which is a social “pheromone”

By hearing all the worker bees. 

Bc our goddess wanted to hear, honey became sweet. 

...

So if we start thinking like this…

Left and Right Ears… 

It’s a familiar pattern and still encoded into our broca’s area and umbilical cord belly button

To understand the ear signals

...

This directly heats up or cools down the body

Right ear is cool (9 of π)

Left ear is hot (1 of π)

And honey is “heat” that the workers like

It represents this “sweetness” about the environment to the earth/star/god
