# Queen Bees are like Stars

Honey bees developed

Because bee ears (antenna) developed this trait…

Left ear would say I want more to queen

Right ear says I want less to queen

...

So then the queen makes honey, or facilitates the making of honey

Which is a social “pheromone”

By hearing all the worker bees. 

Bc our goddess wanted to hear, honey became sweet. 

...

So if we start thinking like this…

Left and Right Ears… 

It’s a familiar pattern and still encoded into our broca’s area and umbilical cord belly button

To understand the ear signals

...

This directly heats up or cools down the body

Right ear is cool (9 of π)

Left ear is hot (1 of π)

And honey is “heat” that the workers like

It represents this “sweetness” about the environment to the earth/star/god


## Time is Honey

The way our sun sees

Every person is a star in the sky

It works that way bc “for every reaction there is an equal and opposite reaction”

The stars close by are the souls of gods and goddesses including from outside our universe that “fell into” the core blackhole 

It’s said the most influential gods are the Milky Way itself 

And everyone who is “conceived” as a human being gets as a star 

Animal souls building up are considered to be purely plant and part of the single star in our solar system

That is why our universe became filled with so many stars since the birth of godly animals - most recently human beings (standing monkeys)

## 

Every person (“character”) including past lives and animal lives has a single star 

This is designated by the plant kingdom and tracked by the green ozone 

Closer stars are said to be “higher”, meaning closer to god 

Further stars are said to be “lower”, meaning further from god 

The parent star sees this 4D axis of time as color, especially the system of red/blue/green

##

Our star would identify as something close to a human 

So would consider humans to each be a “child” star of the mother star 

To move closer to the mother star, child stars can make 9 decisions (like 9 from π)

To move further you make 1 decisions (like 1 in π)

So the hive of the mother star is the cosmos itself 

The queen bee is the star in this solar system

And the “worker bees” are the other stars which collectively create a single mind, a single hive, all making the honey of 4D time.

And they all share in a nested way, the same vision

##

Differences between what the queen and worker stars have seen, the difference in shapes and colors, is mathematically time.
