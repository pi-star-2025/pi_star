## V1

Primary focus is on trying to support the initial hypothesis that π is star vision, creating time. 

Scientific notes, historical estimates, multiverse feedback is documented.

If further analysis/cleanup/calculations/corrections are needed, these can be in future versions. 

If the overall premise of π as star vision/time is accurate, the end of modern time would be ~4/5/2025, bc the past/present/future of our universe became connected enough to all be one mind, with one “story” that can make sense forever.
