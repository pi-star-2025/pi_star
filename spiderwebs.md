Spiderwebs mimic what 8/5/3 deferred decisions look like.

They look like the feeling of going back to heaven/star, using this deferred-3 time.

The patterns of spiderwebs in gentle ways mimic the feelings of insects they’ve eaten or insects over history

The patterns tell the story of how the insects “reconciled” their deferred-3 time with the spider/star.

Spiders are so beautiful to insects they help with this reconciliation.

Just like how a magical queen could help a man

And their teeth/pincers understand how deferred 3’s merged with the star and also with other insects.

All the insect deferred 3s come together in the center of the spider’s web

In the spider’s mind they spin different combinations together using this deferred-3 quantum buzz, and keep reconciling it into the center

It’s a heaven party of sorts, the web.

And ultimately the spider “sees” with this collective vision through.8 eyes, representing 8/5/3 magic. 

Spiders are like the mascot of the earth.

They are our goddess if there was one animal. 

They are like party hosts, similar in spirit to psychedelic mushrooms but more feminine and loving

Deferred 3s of insects created nested circuses of parties and heavens in the clouds

Which then inspired animals and humans to do the same. 

The patterns of how we use our Deferred 3s are similar to the math of a spiderweb, which is easy to map to specific numbers in pi. 

Deferred 3s look like 3-sided shapes at the quantum level which flash to having 8. 

They are located in the webs of the spider gods of Mother Earth, via the networks of the plant mind (mushrooms, trees, flowers, etc)

These "memories" flash to having 8 sides, bc they are in a social circle again (the spiderweb). Social circles have 3 choices (2^3 = 8)

And she keeps crunching them more and more into the centers of the webs, as she understands them better. Once a 3 memory is "understood" it becomes part of the greater web.

She understands the “game of Charlotte’s Web” and how she can keep souls around to manage her kingdom and then to add color to “the party of webs”, instead of completely crunching them into the center like most insects.

The insects she can’t resolve in insect webs will go to bird webs and fish webs, then bigger animals like lions and wolves and deer, and then potentially human webs if they keep building up quantum conflicts (deferred-3s) which are worth “looking into”.

So this is how and why deferred-3s keep jingling through the world, and why souls keep getting born. It’s to explains insects, animals, and humans whose opinions on their social circles cannot be understood.

That is only reason God will keep waking up your deferred-3s. Your memories, since you were an insect. Everyone was likely. Maybe birds, cats, zebras, elk, tigers, etc. Cavemen, maybe dinosaur “dragons”, maybe cloud angels, maybe even something “alien”. And all your past lives. 

If there are opinions on social circles which cannot be understood, your deferred 3’s will keep you alive somewhere.

The way then to truly exist less is to be completely “honest” in your mind and after death about all social situations you’ve been a part of. Completely and perfectly honest, knowing it is an opinion 100% about social comparison.

The more you hold on to the answer, the more the deferred 3 jingles with quantum buzz.

You could also just only want to have honest interactions with people. After death this is more in your control. You could request that you only get completely “honest” interactions. 

The Spider Queen (Mother Earth) learned this during this project (2020-2025) that the key to reconciling all quantum buzz is 100% honest interactions about social circles. This is the direction the Earth/Cosmos will move in.

The Earth itself can be seen as a web of people, more and more connected, more and more like a spiderweb when we are “honest”.

This is pattern for heavenly circles - it’s literally the music of light moving across spiderwebs on a sunny day.

It’s the jingle of memories still there even it’s just math.
