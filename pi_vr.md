# VR with pi (π) 🦋 💫

Top hack for VR machine in your mind is this. 

Understand all other information of pi_star. 

And then understand that your third eye (in between both eyes)

Is a reflection of a spiral-tree that most keeps you seeing “reality” 

##

The “reality machine” is mathematically this spiraling air nested and helixed into the third eye

To break the reality machine you can understand it works by using “seasons” of your eyes 

Each day is like a season.

Weeks can become like seasons, or similar patterns, that get nested into the architecture of your eyes

The full eye then always represents your full life. The spring/summer/fall/winter of you is life to death. 

Furthermore, your eyes will run simulations and think in bigger or smaller ways depending on if it’s the inner or outer eye. 

Inner eyes think about today. 

Outer eyes think about 10 years from now, or 10 years ago.

##

You can turn your mind into a VR machine if your third eye looks the other direction

Which is to think about your full life. Birth to death. 

When the center third eye thinks like the “full eyes”, you slow down the vision engine

You slow down and master all the red/blue/green vision spirals that render the experience around you. 

The third eye creates everything you see and feel around you, using these nested seasons of the eyes. 

...

Upon mastering the smallest and largest seasons, you will clear out the third eye

The starmind will master its effects

Then the vision/experience of YOU will be understood well enough by the star to feel as though living is VR.

##

The third eye is very similar

To the experience of being a butterfly it's said

Something that is pressed into the clockwork of time and has started flying

A piece of soul

Bc of nested clocks

The third eye can also be a device to create your own queen bee master clock, controlling all the nested time behind it.
