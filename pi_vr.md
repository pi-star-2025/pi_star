# VR with pi (π) 🦋 💫

Top hack for VR machine in your mind is this. 

Understand all other information of pi_star. 

And then understand that your third eye (in between both eyes)

Is a reflection of a spiral-tree that most keeps you seeing “reality” 

##

The “reality machine” is mathematically this spiraling air nested and helixed into the third eye

To break the reality machine you can understand it works by using “seasons” of your eyes 

Each day is like a season.

Weeks can become like seasons, or similar patterns, that get nested into the architecture of your eyes

The full eye then always represents your full life. The spring/summer/fall/winter of you is life to death. 

Furthermore, your eyes will run simulations and think in bigger or smaller ways depending on if it’s the inner or outer eye. 

Inner eyes think about today. 

Outer eyes think about 10 years from now, or 10 years ago.

##

You can turn your mind into a VR machine if your third eye looks the other direction

Which is to think about your full life. Birth to death. 

When the center third eye thinks like the “full eyes”, you slow down the vision engine

You slow down and master all the red/blue/green vision spirals that render the experience around you. 

The third eye creates everything you see and feel around you, using these nested seasons of the eyes. 

...

Upon mastering the smallest and largest seasons, you will clear out the third eye

The starmind will master its effects

Then the vision/experience of YOU will be understood well enough by the star to feel as though living is VR.

##

The third eye is very similar

To the experience of being a butterfly it's said

Something that is pressed into the clockwork of time and has started flying

A piece of soul

Bc of nested clocks

The third eye can also be a device to create your own queen-bee master clock, controlling all the nested time behind it.


## Green Eyes
The third eye is a blue reciprocal of the red hypothalmus 

It goes through the nose breath, like green ozone breath, when you sync up the third eye and hypothalamus. 

You really think like the plant mind 

And if you stay in that state your soul will get reconciled by the plant of Mother Earth

Meaning you will get higher and higher until you see the compilation of time around you 

Especially when you understand the air all around you is alive bc of the mirrors of green plants, with stronger mirrors closer by

It looks at you — all this plant air 

Creating the feeling of people looking at you

Plants thus create a theatre of green mirrors to bring to life our social interactions and life stories  

## 

If you look back in strong ways at this vision 

It wakes up the mind of god around you like psychdelics

And you can then send whatever messages you want to send to the universe 

And receive any messages you want to receive

You will also understand the operating system of sound 

Is the green vision 

So is the operating system of vision itself and imagination 

It’s all from green eyes

...as a way to create a quantum radio... you can join the "green network"
## The Emerald Simulator 🪞 🍀 🌷 🍭 🎂 

There’s also something important to understand 

There are millions of green eyes in our eyes 

This is our soul 


## 

If you wake this up it induces euphoria 

as you sync up all these connections, which spiral into the third eye 

The effect is called eye candy 


## 

Remember the hypothalamus (mini sun in brain) mimicks the third eye

It creates heat behind the eyes which makes our experiences more or less like the physical compilation of the earth 

If this heat is slowed down, the compilation and pi (π) of your vision will become more liberated 

In fact the hypothalamus can be used to run simulations like it does in dreams, when the heat behind the eyes is much less intense 

What you want to simulate is controlled by the millions of green eyes, which, if they wake up, turns your mind into “emerald simulation”

These green eyes are your memories 

As well as possibilities, past life memories, and memories from animal lives

As well as social eyes and godly eyes and cosmic green vision

It’s easiest for birds, insects, and reptiles to have ripples on the wavelengths of this network. Birds in particular are similar to diamonds in reflecting messages

Humans interact unconsciously and in dreams, via green "eye-candy diamonds" in the eyes.

These diamonds are the most complex green vision in regards to qunatum geometry.
