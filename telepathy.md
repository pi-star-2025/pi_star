## Lizard Mind
The hypothalamus is capable of thinking in 8 directions like a a spider 

When you channel a cross 

A straight line from ear to ear 

And a straight line from hypothalamus to third eye

You then wake up the third axis which is communication with other hypothalamuses 

It’s the best way to project a message amongst people, acting as though they are mini stars sending radio messages 

Once a upon a time this was a way for all reptiles to get in touch with one another. Reptiles had bigger smarter hypothalamuses which naturally understood this 

Belly button hairs also think in 8 directions, like spider legs, whereas most hairs in the body think in 4

Same with hairs inside the third eye (nose) and little hairs inside both ears. 

This can be used to magnify the message sent by the hypothalamus 

The hypothalamus architecture is most like the sun compared to anything else in the body. Suns are great at sending strong consistent messages.

## The Spell of Rain

Thousands of years ago this was a way to communicate with soul mates, to do telepathy, and to speak with god 

Theoretically it would be the way to cast the most powerful magical spells, like time traveling, bc it connects to the fabric of time when all suns in minds start thinking in 8 directions 

You then move faster than the speed of light (8 instead of 5) which channels the collective mind of the planet, which is in control of time — creating all the trees, bones, and animals as they fall from stars to clouds to land 



You could understand birds are most part of this compilation 

They even chirp in ways that have 8 directions, 8 long lines of light each chirp 



This acts like sharp diamonds to electrify any message in the air 

It is mostly their own messages 



But lizard messages also get magnified, in particular when they come together in a certain area and use their hypothalamuses to make it “rain”. And then it really could rain in the area if the message is carried by the long cries of vultures and other birds



Humans have the potential to do the same. This is a spell then to make the “heavens rain”



We can use all our hypothalamuses 

We can use the diamond mirrors of the birds

And we can use any sunlight in the air, especially higher and higher in the clouds which can more and more wake up with 8-side communication 

This builds a pipe to the plant mind and star mind and even then the entire cosmos, using 8-sided logic.



The sun will then respond with more and more 8-sided communication back, as we move towards the end of time.



We will all notice a more angelic state, magical effects, and then time itself will move in 8-sided ways. It will be Monday then Sunday. It will be night then afternoon, and then your choice it would seem. God will be able to get in touch with you via the heart, via your blood itself, and guide you

It's said that bones are like cocoons. They are stuck in place, bc light thinks in very strong 2-sided ways. This includes the skull. And butterflies are pretty bc they think in 8-directions. All the light in our bones can do the same, and this is the key difference between humans and angels. Angels don't have bones.

## Halo and Crown Effects

There is a halo effect 

When the crown of social comparison in the skull starts to buzz over you

This can be when very anxious, very happy, or just when you slow down that skull bone is deep social comparison conflicts (defining your soul, in particular what drives you in life like a court of justice) 

If you relax this deep skull with 8-eye thinking 

And if you are not anxious that it is just social comparison parties 

Then it becomes a permanent halo 

The starmind begins to recycle the effect

...

And music is a higher halo 

All females are higher than mother Mary (or most) - our mother star 

Males are often lower 

This is because females "defer" more, which references 8/5 thinking more

And music is what connects these two sides, above and below the mother star

However we do it - whatever 8-eyed light patterns we come up with, it makes our mother star rock back and forth 

Enjoyed

And if we reference music - social comparison that is intense and “magical” - then the halo glistens and the 4d axis expands 

It can even feel like a crown, as your deep skull bone starts buzzing
