## Blue_Dream 

The first 4 in π (blue) is the mirror force of the cosmos.

Blue (4) makes the decision to see  red (3), with the first 1.

Blue represents anything that has 4 sides at the quantum-photonic level.

This is oxygen on our planet. 

It reflects the red triangle of the star

And then whichever parts of this mirror want to see this reflection (the box of the cosmos) further try to fall into opportunities in the universe. These are opportunities to find a third force to fall into. 

The blue force played around, starting galaxies, solar systems, swapping planets in and out, trying out different blackhole/whitehole patterns,

Until it fell into the green force of the planet earth.

The blue is everything we see. It is literally oxygen, bc the oxygen is a wrapper ontop of everything. 

Even all matter from our vantage point is oxygen.

It’s not actually oxygen. But what *we* touch, feel, and see is oxygen. 

This comes from the oxygen in our eyes, which are the actual mirrors. We cannot see this, but the mirrors are like oxygen ice.

The eyes are just super tanks of oxygen, many nested mirror mazes of blue. 

All actual sensations (everything except “hearing”) is from these blue 4s.

## Green_Noise

The soul is blue squares “hearing” the green pentagons, which drops you down in your experience. 

Green pentagon represents the 5 in π.

The blue made the decision to fall from 4, with the second 1 of π, bc of the beauty of the blue mirror mazes of earth.

This is felt most as the “sound of the earth” when the fall happens (to make CO2 from O2).

These rhythmic falls led to blue oxygen (quantum blue squares) falling into the green and creating the plant ozone. 

Our existence is actually the same thing. 

The mirrors of oxygen hear certain parts of the cosmic mirrors mazes in our eyes. 4 hears 5.
This happens trillions of times per second. 

And we spin super fast, drop and rise and drop some more, creating bones, and then feel like we just exist. 

All bc of the blue squares hearing the green pentagons. 

All of this happens like plant ozone in our eyes. 

The pentagons most feel like words in our mind. Even before they were words, they would feel like words. 

In some way we just are words. 


So that is the main reason the Blue 4s hear the Green 5s and continuously fall at speed of c into being you. 
Anything you could say or hear = 5 

Everything else = 4 

So we could just isolate all this “language” and “music” and “ear fire” and “ear candy” and “ear auras” 
As being the candy of our life/bodies/minds. 

And we could be everything else and life is just an elevator through our eyes. 

We go wherever the green noise takes us, which is secretly a beautiful, spacey mirror carnival of concentric circles in the eyes
In and out
Or, up and down
