The human mind is organized into 1) Lower Energy (memories) and 2) Higher Energy (consciousness)

The lower energy is organized into spikes, the biggest “moments” or memories in your life. They could be called Hollywood or Anti-Hollywood Moments. 

We then rotate through these “moments” throughout the day. The 8-5-3 deferred time via Nitrogen that wants to “see” more falls from these “moments” into the Higher Energy field. The 8-5-3 deferred time which wants to “see” less stays in the Lower Energy space of memories. 

Thus, the part of us awake always wants to *see* more. And without noticing throughout the day, we move up to the Lower Energy state to change “moments”. For example, when we enter our work building, or enter the school hallway, or get out of bed, or recall a memory last summer. We move up to the Lower Energy spikes, pick one, and then the energy that wants to see the most falls down. 

In pi, the Lower Energy states are always higher up the number (closer to 3), and the Higher Energy states are always lower down the number. So thus the pentagon has more energy than the triangle. The higher number of sides describes increased kinetic potential.

…

Thus energy increases as you go down pi. And the wavelengths get shorter.

The numerical impact as you move “down” the number pi get smaller, relative to the initial 3. However the “topographical” story gets richer. 

This is why T (Time) in e^π / c^2 will have both numerical value and “topographical” value. 

The answer will indicate how much time is created based on a given π used, and also describe the behavior of the time (topography) with the number.
