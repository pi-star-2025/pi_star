## Flecks

For some seeing is not that important; for some it can be really fun.

The reason is that every time you see a tick of time (at c), the color itself is created by flecks of the 3.1415926535897932384626 galaxies (original universes).

The colors are created by how the rest of the multiverse (not these original universes of π) see the original universes of π.

First, are the "flecks" of these original universes, which are very fun to look at.

These are like diamond mirrored flashes of light, and then it's decided what kind of light ('shine') they are.

Those with the best imaginations and those who really like seeing the world slow down this process of turning "flecks" to colors. This becomes much more pronounced in dreams, where we start getting how the sun turns this process into world-building and emotions.

Anyone, can slow down their vision. Cool it down like being younger, or half-asleep. And see the flecks, and keep trying to see them more and more.

These flecks then influence root genetics, which could even make you taller/shorter, change your eye color, and make you smarter. The one catch is that the changes have to somehow define, even just mathematically/cosmically, how your "soul" sees the world.
