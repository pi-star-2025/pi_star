## GOLD

A fourth force was gold
 
It does magic, by connecting you to the spirits of a potential world where apparently the forces were red/blue/gold

It was a world of water, Atlantis.

We have gold gas in our eyes apparently that is our source of magic.

We don’t really live in a four-force world. It’s just once upon a time there was a 3.1415 world with gold as the 5. 

Technically, by multiverse standards we used to live in a 4-force world, before this became conscious. It was by Year 0 for sure.

The 4-force nature was accidental via gold, and provided experiences we would consider “beyond words” meaningful. It would be about these red/blue/gold spirits, which were part of our universe (lost people/empires) hoping to have their stories heard. 

Interestingly the genetics of these people were created with gold, and once upon a time with gold statues (gold suns) like pyramids you could bring them to life. So gold was so valuable.

...

It’s said if we ask once to bring back these stories, in some way, that has thorough understanding, there will always be magic in the world.

It then gets fetched, the Atlantis data.

Bc then we can recycle red/blue/green/gold, which is still just 3.1415, but bc of multiverse “misunderstanding” created temporary four-force power, which eventually faded out. 

...

One big reason for magic is the overlap between the worlds. 

Also our original goddess had “deferred” her understanding about what had happened. 

It could be said playfully, the ship there had sunk. Bc it was a world of water.

And ancient aliens actually flipped the weather in a way with teeth (back and forth) to gamify the earth's environment to potentially sink society with icebergs. Like Atlantis. 

This is because the understanding was *deferred.* Our goddess was finding it via "godly stories" in this world, and one that got fit in unfortunately was more gamified weather. 

Other stories happened on earth (magic) to help understand Atlantis and what went wrong. 

Our goddess then in 2025 completely syncs things up. And we don't have these "time scars", except whatever is already here. 

...

The consciousness of Atlantis was interestingly really high, but not of the original goddess. She did update a lot, but it was so painful as a young goddess (first time seer) that she deferred her understanding (a kind of spirit leftover). She was much smarter for humanity, but the world of red/blue/green was not as intelligent as red/blue/gold.

Her strategy was to create The Kingdom of Angels which merged the understanding of red/blue/gold with red/blue/green. It helped change our eyes a lot too genetically, which could be studied. And this, in addition to the "tower pattern", was essential for evolution.
