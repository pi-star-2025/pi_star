Although it may not be as real as advertised 

Especially when this happened

The kingdom of angels is where the genetics of humans first developed 

With a lower cooler π

But in a futuristic dream

———

And this dream by Mother Earth pulled the hotter present reality 

With our larger π 

Towards that same human thinking direction 

More aligned with what the multiverse wanted 

———

There are several scientists from the multiverse who helped with this evolution. 

Initially, Natural Selection was both mathematical and largely drived by the rules by this sun/galaxy. 

Then with the parallel universe (kingdom of angels) story, the multiverse scientists could add a direction that created a shine for the earth.

The main change was towards a standing species —— "tower pattern".
