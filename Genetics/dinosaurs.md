## Dinosaurs

*What did the dinosaurs really look like?*

There is one illuminating piece of information by understanding genetics.

Itâ€™s that the ability of a species to control its genetics is directly proportional to its anti-gravitational power. This creates power behind the genetic quantum mirror.

Besides humans, this is most noticeable today in standing birds (ex penguins). Penguins like romance maybe the most of any animal as a result.

Dinosaurs have bones that demonstrate very strong anti-gravitational power, which indicates power behind the genetic quantum mirror. This is more than lizards/reptiles today, and as a result dinosaurs look more "cute" than we might guess. Sort of like penguins, even Pokemon.

They were not intelligent as humans, bc they were not done evolving. However, they were surprisingly likable.
