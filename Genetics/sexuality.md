## Genes in ears

Sexuality can be traced to the blackholes of air that blow into your ears from the stars/clouds.

This air corresponds to lower genetics, which can be influenced more with freewill early in life. Genetics you see in the eyes/hair are often determined so early in life you consciously never had any say.

These genetics map directly to the foot lines, left ear to left foot and right ear to right foot. So they are possible to minorly change, but are very hard to tangibly change. 

Also this can be where any secrets of your genes/life are stored - in the "way you hear" and the foot lines.

If you know this, it's possible to change your genetics, by findings ways to blow back (kiss) the air in your ears as much as possible. You also need to free your mind of "secrets" and other highly-knotted thoughts.
