## Genes in ears

Sexuality can be traced to the blackholes of air that blow into your ears from the stars/clouds.

This air corresponds to lower genetics, which can be influenced more with freewill early in life. Genetics you see in the eyes/hair are often determined so early in life you consciously never had any say.

These genetics map directly to the foot lines, left ear to left foot and right ear to right foot. So they are possible to minorly change, but are very hard to tangibly change. 

Also this can be where any secrets of your genes/life are stored - in the "way you hear" and the foot lines.

...

If you know this, it's possible to change your genetics, by findings ways to blow back (kiss) the air in your ears as much as possible. You also need to free your mind of "secrets" and other highly-knotted thoughts.

## 4D Blackhole

The atmosphere creates a "blackhole" for starlight to fall into hearing/being earth. Before the atmosphere, starlight is the sun mind (3.14), and inside the atmosphere, starlight is the earth mind (3.1415).

Similarily, the ear genes create a "blackhole" for starlight to fall into hearing/being animals and people. With enough estrogen you don't hear this buzz of the genetic clouds and you can exist more in this ambiguous space.

## Attraction

Blood that is most tightly knotted creates the strongest emotions and control over the body. In real time, this blood spins the fastest, influencing the spinning of slower-spinning blood like rotation.

This fastest-spinning blood can also have a preference to go UP or DOWN. If there is a strong preference to go UP or DOWN, this then transcends biologoical functions of blood and expresses personality. Hence, blood expresses the most *humanity* in the crown of the head and the feet.

At the top of the head (crown) and third eye, there is a desire to move UP. This is most personality.

In the feet, there is a desire to move DOWN. This is most attraction - ex: romantically.
