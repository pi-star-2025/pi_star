## Genetics

Genetics are based on live air (nitrogen) decisions at a very deep level, happening only in the eyes

If you focused the deep air in the eyes enough you could “enhance” these decisions

...

This is based on understanding pi (π), to get how less conscious air is thinking. And then what was an unconscious process before can improve with conscious guidance.

## Clouds

The mind of trees and plants uses the clouds in the area 

This includes individual clouds in the sky (puffy, vaporous, hazy)

These are the same clouds deepest in your body, including in your eyes 

Basic genetics, related to metabolism and organ functioning, are laced into these clouds, and could even be referenced with tears and heavy air (nitrogen) in the eyes

## Video Game ATGC

As you go further back into the 3-body problem of the two stars in your eyes, genetic patterns are criss-crossed with flowery color like a video game. 

This is also the part of the mind that runs simulations and replays memories. It's the fire in your eyes, which if slowed down, turns into imagination.
