## RNA 

RNA describes the vision of 1 star, whereas DNA describes the vision of 2 stars.

Hence, life with DNA is more complex, having evolved from RNA-based life.

However, a virus with RNA could pass along a highly linear message, which behaves more mechanically.

RNA behaves like quantum strings, whereas as DNA behaves like quantum waves.

RNA is a smart string; DNA is a smart wave.
