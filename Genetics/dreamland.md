## Dreamland

A large part of life on earth is shaped by the fact that God ran a red/blue/gold world which ended with a River of Hades.

But this information is deferred. 

And our earth is the world which came after. 

The biggest evidence is the preference to develop sleep cycles. Every night our souls sync towards the River of Hades, run by an evil ancient alien, who was hoping this world would also end with a "sinking ship".

It's said all our souls, including the soul of the earth mind, falls down each night and "resets". It resets it's understanding about how The Hydra uses game theory and Ï€ curses to keep us falling to the River of Hades in Atlantis.
