## Hair

Hair can be attractive, like eyes, because you can see genetics in hair very clearly.

With long hair, you can more clearly see genetics. In particular, the genetics of hair visibly pertain more to physical appearance and physical health. Eyes are more comprehensive.

Men like to fall in their genetics, to more "low" earthly traits. So enjoy looking at long hair, sometimes.

Women can as well. But traditional female attraction is to rising up genetically. So long hair may not be as eye-catching.

Through attraction up or down, you can trace how genetics map from the eyes through the hair, through the body.

To the multiverse, the genetics (seeing choices) of the original goddess (Ï€ triangle) are cartoonish. They come out in the back-and-forth interplay with the other stars, via ATCG.

All other stars have a classical style that women (and the original goddess) are attracted to. These seeing choices are more practical and historically great.

The sun has a certain style which is new/creative/bright. Men, who evolved as older souls falling in, are attracted to falling down and adopting some of these new techniques.
