## Seeds

All life is like a tree 

It first figures out the straight line of π

How the universe goes from a c^2 mirror to atoms via 3.141592

For a tree the straight answer is the trunk going up 

And then its “mind” branches into 3-sided possibilities 

...

All life stores their “straight line” 3.141592 answer in some kind of seed 

And then they can pass on the secrets of π and starting life 

(this even applies to cosmic entities, like stars)

For humans the belly button is the final seed, and for the average person is the main source of freewill
