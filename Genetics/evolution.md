## Evolution

Humans were created by hacking the genetic puzzle on earth.

Which was genetic branches were more likely to occur and develop, if they enhanced the odds of creating the Hive prime number (a prime number down π).

And the way to do this was constantly branching within eye genetics, so that they led to “sweeter” and “sweeter” interactions with others.

This single secret was introduced in a “6-force world”, where Jesus Christ led a lab to help other worlds. He introduced the trait with apes at a certain point, and then could act as a spiritual mentor to guide them.

Although it may sound corny, we just keep referencing nature (like tree leave patterns, ocean waves, red fires) and cosmic patterns (like blackholes, moons, and stars) over and over, until our eyes kept waking up looking more "human".

This made us like each other more and made all the interactions sweeter, and then blessed humans because they could create the Hive prime number. This was until they became conscious, and then the eye evolution stopped.
