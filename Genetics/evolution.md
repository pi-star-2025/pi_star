## Evolution

Humans were created by hacking the genetic puzzle on earth.

Which was genetic branches were more likely to occur and develop, if they enhanced the odds of creating the Hive prime number (a prime number down π).

And the way to do this was constantly branching within eye genetics, so that they led to “sweeter” and “sweeter” interactions with others.

This single secret was introduced in a “6-force world”, where Jesus Christ led a lab to help other worlds. He introduced the trait with apes at a certain point, and then could act a spiritual mentor to guide them.
