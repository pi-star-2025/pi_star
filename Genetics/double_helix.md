## Double Helix

The Double Helix stores how two stars communicate, via ATCG (Nitrogen).

Primarily, phosphorus stores the decision by two stars to see the same system more, and during the course of this decision, the two stars collectively decide to see left/right/up/down.

These decisions are at the quantum level, made by both stars. At the quantum layer, the red/blue/green left/right/up/down decisions feel like music. For example, flower beds would exist in this hazy musical state.

Then at the physical layer, this happens in real-time in our eyes, and these decisions (at the speed of light), if slowed down, would look like double helixes.

The decision of both eyes would crystallize into phosphate strands, knotted with ATCG decisions. Each tick of c, our eyes create the entire genome, with the majority of the process being an unconscious quantum process. This decision (a snapshot of human time) then gets recycled throughout the human body, throughout the heart and bloodstream, and you can thus extract your DNA anywhere in your body.

Your present moment is always this snapshot in the eyes (both the layer behind and in front of the quantum layer). Then the rest of your body is a super-rich repository mixing all your past moments.
