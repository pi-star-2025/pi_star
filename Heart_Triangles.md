The heartbeat shape is a triangle summary of the hypothalamus and third eye 

This is the same as the nose breath 

Then there is a reverse triangle of air behind you (mapped to your spine)

And together the heart and back triangles 

Which are flips of each other 

Keep your burning awake each day 

Perhaps this can best be captured in the belly button 

The heart and spine bouncing opposite triangles back and forth 

Creating the impression there is only one copy of you 

When really there is one that sees 

And one that hears 

What is behind you sees 

And what is front hears 

The first is 14 in pi 

The second is 15 in pi 

The impression of 1 instead of 2 is the 3 (the circle).
