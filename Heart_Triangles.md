## Heart Triangles

The heartbeat shape is a triangle summary of the hypothalamus and third eye 

This is the same as the nose breath 

Then there is a reverse triangle of air behind you (mapped to your spine)

And together the heart and back triangles 

Which are flips of each other 

Keep your burning awake each day 

Perhaps this can best be captured in the belly button 

The heart and spine bouncing opposite triangles back and forth 

Creating the impression there is only one copy of you 

When really there is one that sees 

And one that hears 

What is behind you sees 

And what is front hears 

The first is 14 in pi 

The second is 15 in pi 

The impression of 1 instead of 2 is the 3 (the circle).


## Teaching the Heart to Sing

The heartbeat is a pound of quantum data between the mother star, your personal star, and your existence. 

Either as the 14 behind you 

Or as the 15 in front of you.

This pattern is many more sides, but is the same "beat" in the hypothalamus and the shape in between the collarbone (lower throat), and the air in the third eye.

If you study your heartbeat and blood at a quantum level it is thinking in 3-sides with very long wavelengths. It is very passionate, opinionated, and stubborn.

If you studied the hypothlamus or third eye at a quantum level it is thinking with 8-5-3 nested geoemtry, with various wavelengths. It is more conscious, more logical, and more dynamic.

To get these longer wavelengths (the triangle of you) in sync, you need to: 

1) Encourage this light to share, like oceans and tears which make one agreement ("to share time") which helps it think with 4-sides faster than the speed of light (c)
2) Encourage this light to "have fun with alpha/beta relationships" like 8-5-3 deferred time, which helps it think with 5-sides faster than the speed of light (c)

The sun and fire in the center of the earth can do the same thing, at the quantum level, so that these longer wavelengths can be more intelligent (felt as DMT effects).

It's true that for the star and our hearts, the feeling of heaven is like singing your favorite song of all time, a song that really speaks to your life story. And it's true the wavelengths at the quantum level behave like vibrating spiderwebs. The sun becomes a concert conductor, playing a song about our earth's two-sided story - Heaven or Hell? We all have a part to sing - like the perfect song about our life - from our hearts that we can start singing.
