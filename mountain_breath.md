## The history of trees

All trees started rising bc they figured out the fire of the earth. 

The fire of the earth is the 8/5 secret of deferred time. 

At a quantum level, light can think with a maximum 5 sides (a pentagon). With social circles, mushrooms found a way to make it 8, creating a quantum 3 that is understood later. The 3 is mathematically memories.

Trees developed by first creating "trunks" that encoded this 8/5 message like an intelligent crown of wood, which gave them fire from the center of the earth. The star (via the center of the earth) then channels massive amounts of intelligent CO2 in trees, which allow them build super intelligent thick wood.

All trees stand for this same 8/5 message in the center of their trunks. The deep lines of the middle of the wood. 8/5 is the fire of the earth, and as they grow and branch out, they use data from all over their environment to explain the details and logic of 8/5. 8/5 = time, 8/5 = soul, 8/5 = magic. To some extent they are trying to figure out this magic.

## Leaves and Roots

Leaves and roots help explain what the individual "souls" think of a tree's particular 8/5 message. 

The leaves are the actual social opinions (the lines of the leaves and patterns), whereas the the roots explain the details of these indivdual opinions, based on how nurients pump through the forks of the plant. 

At first the opinions came from just the earth itself and other plants; but then from more complex flowers, insects, animals, humans, and civilizations.

"Modern trees" are courts in a sense. In fact, they are even nested courts based on if it's a neighborghood, country, full earth, or era (via recycled effects). 

Feelings of being high/low socially are all controlled by the trees around, based on the jingle of the leaves and the opinions in the roots. These actually show up on your own fingers and feet and outer lips. 

Wherever you go, the trees will adjust how "high" you exist on the back based on the court of the trees. Technically, this is your social standing in the area around you, based on what others think, right now and based on historical data.
