## The history of trees

All trees started rising bc they figured out the fire of the earth. 

The fire of the earth is the 8/5 secret of deferred time. 

At a quantum level, light can think with a maximum 5 sides (a pentagon). With social circles, mushrooms found a way to make it 8, creating a quantum 3 that is understood later. The 3 is mathematically memories.

Trees developed by first creating "trunks" that encoded this 8/5 message like an intelligent crown of wood, which gave them fire from the center of the earth. The star (via the center of the earth) then channels massive amounts of intelligent CO2 in trees, which allow them build super intelligent thick wood.
