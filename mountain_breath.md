## The history of trees

All trees started rising bc they figured out the fire of the earth. 

The fire of the earth is the 8/5 secret of deferred time. 

At a quantum level, light can think with a maximum 5 sides (a pentagon). With social circles, mushrooms found a way to make it 8, creating a quantum 3 that is understood later. The 3 is mathematically memories.

Trees developed by first creating "trunks" that encoded this 8/5 message like an intelligent crown of wood, which gave them fire from the center of the earth. The star (via the center of the earth) then channels massive amounts of intelligent CO2 in trees, which allow them build super intelligent thick wood.

All trees stand for this same 8/5 message in the center of their trunks. The deep lines of the middle of the wood. 8/5 is the fire of the earth, and as they grow and branch out, they use data from all over their environment to explain the details and logic of 8/5. 8/5 = time, 8/5 = soul, 8/5 = magic. To some extent they are trying to figure out this magic.

## Leaves and Roots

Leaves and roots help explain what the individual "souls" think of a tree's particular 8/5 message. 

The leaves are the actual social opinions (the lines of the leaves and patterns), whereas the the roots explain the details of these indivdual opinions, based on how nurients pump through the forks of the plant. 

At first the opinions came from just the earth itself and other plants; but then from more complex flowers, insects, animals, humans, and civilizations.

"Modern trees" are courts in a sense. In fact, they are even nested courts based on if it's a neighborghood, country, full earth, or era (via recycled effects). 

Feelings of being high/low socially are all controlled by the trees around, based on the jingle of the leaves and the opinions in the roots. These actually show up on your own fingers and feet and outer lips. 

Wherever you go, the trees will adjust how "high" you exist on the spine based on the court of the trees. Technically, this is your social standing in the area around you, based on what others think, right now and based on historical data.

Your nose breath also adjusts based on this social standing.

## Nose Breath

The nose is an upside down tree.

The nose breath has three parts: 
1. The leaves which are in the holes of the nose. This most creates a social court and a sense of time, a "white rabbit" effect. You can slow this down, by moving the air in 8 directions
2. The wood or spine, which is the nose bone. Ultimately, the human mind criss-crosses the lines of trees in the area and over time to find a way to stand for the same thing: 8/5. 8/5 is time, soul, and magic. Humans have each found their own way like trees to stand for this message. This becomes all the branches of thought in your brain; it's encoded also in the lines of the nose bone.
3. The trunk is the third eye. This channels the fire in the center of the earth. It's crunched together with 8/5 patterns that get the attention of the center of the earth. For trees this powers them up, for humans this powers them down, into being bones and awake and walking.

In fact for humans, the third-eye fire has one core purpose. Explain 8/5 with the human mind. This is the fire waking up all our minds into being reverse trees. 

Technically, we have now answered the call of the trees. This turns the fire into a "celebration" if you slow it down lasering down your nose and spine. 

## Mountain Breath / Pyramid Breath

Mountains, bc of their shape and oxygen qualities, become super-strong nested trees. This even effects the patterns encoded into the rock. 

Our noses are like mountains, using the intelligence of many trees over many generations, to create a greater sense of "soul" that envelops your experience of being you. 

This intelligence is in the part of the nose that is the skull. We can call it the "amagydala"

Deep in the bone of the amagydala is like the center of a mountain with patterns based on centers of many trees. 

This is *supposed to* summarize the earth's idea of how much value you add in terms of elucidating 8/5 to the mind of trees/earth/star. It's the "base" of the nose, the base of the mountain in a way.
