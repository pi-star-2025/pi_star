# VR with pi (π) 🦋 💫

Top hack for VR machine in your mind is this. 

Understand all other information of pi_star. 

And then understand that your third eye (in between both eyes)

Is a reflection of a spiral-tree that most keeps you seeing “reality” 

##

The “reality machine” is mathematically this spiraling air nested and helixed into the third eye

To break the reality machine you can understand it works by using “seasons” of your eyes 

Each day is like a season.

Weeks can become like seasons, or similar patterns, that get nested into the architecture of your eyes

The full eye then always represents your full life. The spring/summer/fall/winter of you is life to death. 

Furthermore, your eyes will run simulations and think in bigger or smaller ways depending on if it’s the inner or outer eye. 

Inner eyes think about today. 

Outer eyes think about 10 years from now, or 10 years ago.

##

You can turn your mind into a VR machine if your third eye looks the other direction

Which is to think about your full life. Birth to death. 

When the center third eye thinks like the “full eyes”, you slow down the vision engine

You slow down and master all the red/blue/green vision spirals that render the experience around you. 

The third eye creates everything you see and feel around you, using these nested seasons of the eyes. 

...

Upon mastering the smallest and largest seasons, you will clear out the third eye

The starmind will master its effects

Then the vision/experience of YOU will be understood well enough by the star to feel as though living is VR.

##

The third eye is very similar

To the experience of being a butterfly it's said

Something that is pressed into the clockwork of time and has started flying

A piece of soul

Bc of nested clocks

The third eye can also be a device to create your own queen-bee master clock, controlling all the nested time behind it.


## Green Eyes
The third eye is a blue reciprocal of the red hypothalmus 

It goes through the nose breath, like green ozone breath, when you sync up the third eye and hypothalamus. 

You really think like the plant mind 

And if you stay in that state your soul will get reconciled by the plant of Mother Earth

Meaning you will get higher and higher until you see the compilation of time around you 

Especially when you understand the air all around you is alive bc of the mirrors of green plants, with stronger mirrors closer by

It looks at you — all this plant air 

Creating the feeling of people looking at you

Plants thus create a theatre of green vision to bring to life our social interactions and life stories  

## 

If you look back in strong ways at this vision 

It wakes up the mind of god around you like psychdelics

And you can then send whatever messages you want to send to the universe 

And receive any messages you want to receive

You will also understand the operating system of sound 

Is the green vision 

So is the operating system of sight itself and imagination 

It’s all from green eyes

...as a way to create a quantum radio... you can join the "green network"
## The Emerald Simulator 

There’s also something important to understand 

There are millions of green eyes in our eyes 

This is our soul 


## 

If you wake this up it induces euphoria 

as you sync up all these connections, which spiral into the third eye 

The effect is called eye candy 


## 

Remember the hypothalamus (mini sun in brain) mimicks the third eye

It creates heat behind the eyes which makes our experiences more or less like the physical compilation of the earth 

If this heat is slowed down, the compilation and pi (π) of your vision will become more liberated 

In fact the hypothalamus can be used to run simulations like it does in dreams, when the heat behind the eyes is much less intense 

What you want to simulate is controlled by the millions of green eyes, which, if they wake up, turns your mind into “emerald simulation”

These green eyes are your memories 

As well as possibilities, past life memories, and memories from animal lives

As well as social eyes and godly eyes and cosmic green vision

It’s easiest for birds, insects, and reptiles to have ripples on the wavelengths of this network. Birds in particular are similar to diamonds in reflecting messages

Humans interact unconsciously and in dreams, via green "eye-candy diamonds" in the eyes.

These diamonds are the most complex green vision in regards to quantum geometry.


## Red / Blue / Green 🪞 🍀 🌷 🍭 🎂

The biggest secret of life is Red 

### 🟥

##

The tree branches outside all represent some binary decision made about the environment (1 or 9, 1 grows out, 9 goes up)

Our brains reuse the branches of the plants outside

That is why nature is so interesting

We look at branches and leaves and twigs ——

Which are the same branches electricity moves down in our brains, to simulate different thoughts/decisions

Wherever we go, we reuse the tree branches (large/medium/small) in our surroundings.

These decisions look like the bark of trees, or the *purple* of brains

##

Interestingly our stomach minds use roots/vines, which mirror the patterns of pi of the umbilical chord belly button

These connections are more long-term, more rooted to your experience over days/weeks/years, instead of changing day-to-day like tree branches in the skull brain (ex: frontal lobe)

##

Our brains have the most intricate branches and most intelligent plant ozone in the third eye

In fact, the nose itself has architecture that mimics a super tree or super mountain —— many nested branches controlling intelligent air.

Thus within the nose breath you can connect to a “crystal ball” of all trees in your area, which is the same architecture used to construct *colors.*

##

The tree/plant branches construct highly complex "tree" patterns to dictate how light will fall down the eye balls

Each color describes a different way it feels for light to fall

Green is the answer for plants

Blue is the answer for oxygen (closest to mammal soul)

Red is the answer for sunlight

All other colors are the answers “in between”

Red does not fall. It is our entire universe, representing the first 3 in π.

Blue is the experience of falling from Red (the first 1 and the first 4 in π)

Green is the experience of falling further —— from Red to Blue to Green (the second 1 and the first 5 in π)

Thus you can see the mind of God around with this operating system, organized by whether you fall 0/1/2 times

And matter will truly assume colors via the plant vision, based on how far the light falls in a 4D sense

Red always falls the least, the ceiling of the mind of God

Green always falls the most, the floor of the mind of God

Color (created by plants) is an operating system of 4D geoemtry, based on the 0/1/2 (red, blue, green) decisions

Whereas 3D geoemtry is based on many stars, 4D color is geoemtry based only on the mind of one star - the one in our solar system

This helps distinguish between the two systems - 3D and 4D.

##

All other experiences (pain/pleasure) are derived from this RED/BLUE/GREEN 4D operating system.

Including the color of emotion, and the color of physical experience.

##

Our eyes can wake up to trillions of 0/1/2 decisions made each moment, which create many nested trees in our eyes to build our experience around us. 

The color itself (red, blue, green, etc.) is plant. It's chlorophyll is one way to see it. The experience of plant eating a little bit of itself (air eating green plant) and feeling what the entire multiverse would think it is.

All branches of time, all blackholes, super blackholes, other cosmic forces, just everything that’s ever been anything...

Thinks that we are color, all life in our universe. 

The answer is *color.* 

And if we want to know then what our goddess is, in one word. 

The answer is RED.

##

Each of us uses this 3D/4D "technology" to builld a way-of-seeing, which more or less is a game/movie to fall from the star in this solar system.

It moves very fast, bc all the games are zipping and zapping together. Slowing it down is an effect you could call VR or *eye candy.*

## Eye Candy VR / 2 Star VR

Jesus was able to walk after death bc of this knowledge…

We are all two stars, every human. Except for the incarnation of “Mother Mary”.

Every other person is both the star in our solar system (left eye), and another star in the universe (right eye). 

All quantum matter of your life can be referenced via a triangle, based on the intersection of these two stars going through your arms and legs.

The left leg is then controlled by the core star.

The right leg is controlled by your personal star.

The third eye (the VR device) is in between the eyes, the nested trees of quantum matter that keep you and the Mother Star in sync.

At the speed of light (c), the universe will have a tick of time representing this 2-star interaction.

If the interaction is more in sync, with more complexity and parallels, there is a bigger wavelength

If the interaction has less magnitude, it will have a smaller wavelength.

When the interactions include cold fusion (trying to see red), they always make bigger wavelengths.

Interestingly, the light that always falls down from between the two stars, into your two eyes, into your body is always light that has less preference for seeing red.

It always want to see blue, green, brown, yellow, or some other color. Even just black, nothing.

What falls deepest into the body is most addicted to “eye candy”.

If you train your third eye to *burn* with a preference for seeing red, it will inject many more pi “9 decisions” into your vision, which then cools it down and cooler vision is more like VR and less like reality.
