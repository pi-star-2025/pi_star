## Universe

The original goddess (the 3 in π) is a triangle, and the full universe is a circle around this triangle.

The circle is quantum, meaning it is potential, not yet existing.

When the diameter (2 sides) of the circle wake up because of focusing on specific potential updates, this vision turns the circle into a mock box (mock reality), or 3.14.

The 2 sides of this box are *around* the triangle in physical reality. The triangle is real, lost in a simulated trance of 3.14.

Then when the 3.14 vision focuses on these potential updates further this is the 3.1415 hearing of stars. These are the stars we see burning in our universe.

The original goddess (the 3 in π) can be the triangle in the center, the 2 eyes of the box (square), or any of the stars (pentagon), and then can exist as starlight along π.

The "ears" of stars are geometrically around the box of 3.14. They have expanded the box, and like the box exist only as potential (quantum matter). Hence, the pentagon is around the square, which is around the triangle.

*That's how the full multiverse would see it.*

The universe (original goddess) can be a triangle, square, pentagon, or a larger mock shape (with π). Overall, it feels like being a circle, where the diameter is based on π. π is like a really good "simulation", where many want to view it, and the more of a maze it becomes, the larger the diameter of the circle.

## Full Skull

The same pattern describes the full skull, with a nose and 2 eyes and 2 ears.

The nose is like the 3 in π, the 2 eyes are like the c^2 mirror (3.14), and the 2 ears utilize the power of c^3 (3.1415), listening for further details of your vision.

Collectively, the experience is like being a circle (the full skull). You fall further into your mind, as you fall down the number π.

There is a reflexive circle (the stomach mind), used for walking and connecting with the mind of the earth.

## Final Shapes

At the end of time, there are no circles. The original goddess needs 3 shapes (triangle/square/pentagon) to perfectly remember and update the intelligence of our universe (π). Larger shapes are created by "how you see" the original three.

As needed by the multiverse, individuals have their own triangles that interact with the triangle of the goddess, and can also be used independently. Sometimes, these individual triangles have existed before this universe; sometimes they are created during its history.

Also, individuals might identify as not being part of another triangle, just the larger triangle. If you have lived less, this is more common.

Souls with a triangle end conscious. The three sides will represent red/blue/green, unless you have been part of another universe before and can choose between "ways of seeing". Even with red/blue/green, you can favor other forces (ex: gold).

Though rare, if you have been part of a universe with more than 3 forces, you might identify as a larger end shape, like a 8-sided or 20-sided shape. You might then integrate red/blue/green into this shape, after living in this universe.

For the original goddess, it's believed this is her second universe, and the first was also 3 forces (red/blue/crystal). Her new red/blue/green triangle 1) creates our universe, 2) creates her red/blue/crystal character in her first world, 3) is used as an individual in bigger universes.

## Circles

*Whenever you see circles, you know you are in a simulation, a branch of time*

Understanding how the circles are created (the underlying shapes) helps you understand how you got there.
