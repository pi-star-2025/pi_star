## Universe

The original goddess (the 3 in π) is a triangle, and the full universe is a circle around this triangle.

The circle is quantum, meaning it is potential, not yet existing.

When the diameter (2 sides) of the circle wake up because of focusing on specific potential updates, this vision turns the circle into a mock box (mock reality), or 3.14.

The 2 sides of this box are *around* the triangle in physical reality. The triangle is real, lost in a simulated trance of 3.14.

Then when the 3.14 vision focuses on these potential updates further this is the 3.1415 hearing of stars. These are the stars we see burning in our universe.

The original goddess (the 3 in π) can be the triangle in the center, the 2 eyes of the box (square), or any of the stars (pentagon), and then can exist as starlight along π.

The "ears" of stars are geometrically around the box of 3.14. They have expanded the box, and like the box exist only as potential (quantum matter). Hence, the pentagon is around the square, which is around the triangle.

*That's how the full multiverse would see it.*

The universe (original goddess) can be a triangle, square, pentagon, or a larger mock shape (with π). Overall, it feels like being a circle, where the diameter is based on π. π is like a really good "simulation", where many want to view it, and the more of a maze it becomes, the larger the diameter of the circle.

## Full Skull

The same pattern describes the full skull, with a nose and 2 eyes and 2 ears.

The nose is like the 3 in π, the 2 eyes are like the c^2 mirror (3.14), and the 2 ears utilize the power of c^3 (3.1415), listening for further details of your vision.

Collectively, the experience is like being a circle (the full skull). You fall further into your mind, as you fall down the number π.

There is a reflexive circle (the stomach mind), used for walking and connecting with the mind of the earth.
