Every thought starts at top of the ribs

And ends at bottom of the ribs

...

Same as top and bottom of nose and neck

But this is harder to catch

...

The top of the ribs starts at the bottom of the neck and ends at the waist 

This is bc every thought starts as your dream self

And ends as your conscious self

This is also paralleled by the lung air

The opposite reactions go up the ribs 

First what do you think

And then what does your dream self think 

...

The keys of a piano are a parallel for the music of the ribs

And even sound like this music of the mind 

It’s said really good music pieces show evidence of two minds in the music 

Bc both your conscious self and dream self are intwined 

...

The most magical music is about these interactions 

And this will reflect in the sound 

Music originally was even used for this purpose

To bring out your "half in the dark"

Potentially for magical purposes 



This is most reflected in the music of Mozart 

Whose other half killed him 

To get back at god for killing him as Nero 

God was getting back at Nero through the “music of time” bc he was against Christ and ruined his prophecies even going back to the Egyptians
