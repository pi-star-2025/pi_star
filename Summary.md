## Summary

In our universe, life is best described by 3.1415 from π. 

This is a common pattern to start a universe, where 3 stands for the vision/intention to create a universe with 3 forces. It is initiated with the power of c by our core goddess. 

This initial vision is the 3.1 in π. The initial vision is directed at “everything” (all matter) in the multiverse, represented by 4.

Looking at everything with such strength creates a “court case”, reflected back as an “equal and opposite reaction.” This creates the “court” of our universe represented by the c^2 mirror and the 3.14 in π.

So the 3.14 in π represents 2 eyes (or a box). The original goddess looking at everything in the multiverse, and everything in the multiverse looking back, creating the fabric of the cosmos in this universe. 

The 15 is nested a dimension within the c^2 mirror. It is represented by light being controlled again with c^3 power, such as by burning suns and blackholes. 

Bc 3 eyes creates the potential for preference by the “seer” (such as preference for flowers by nitrogen), this 3 is expanded to π and thus energetic potential at c^π, not just c^3. 

Gravity is what is manifested by 3.1415 (the effects of c^3 or the acceleration of light), and then life is the further slowing down of light, or what comes after the 3.1415. 

… 

On earth, the 5 is evinced to stand for the force of plants/green via nitrogen electrons primarily. Bc life comes *under* the vision of the green 5 of 3.1415 as red/blue/green. 

Theoretically, 3.1415 could have been created from other life patterns or turned into 3.141516 or 3.14151617 patterns, nesting light in deeper geometry.

… 

At the highest level, red is the vision of the original goddess. Blue is the multiverse (i.e. all matter ever) which can thus be updated by her vision. There is a constant mirror between the two, represented by the electromagnetic field, understood as the c^2 mirror. 

*Within* this highest vision, red is individual stars. Blue is space controlled by the immense c^3 gravity of these stars, evidenced by the rotation of planets. Hence, the rotation of planets is equivalent to the bouncing back and forth of light beams, but in a nested dimension. 

Earth nests this concept even further. The force of blue turns into the sky and water, behaving in electromagnetic patterns like the rotation of planets, evidenced by tides and weather and waves. So the blue is further slowed down. At this slower pace, green develops via the electrons of carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, iron, and other earth elements.

Insects, animals, humans, and societies then nested these red/blue/green themes further. 

…

Each individual seer in our universe has its own pi. For example a star, or an animal. Anything seeing with “3 eyes”.

This creates potential at c^π. 

Up to c^2, the “time” can be described by the “velocity” of light, or the electromagnetic mirror, described by 3.14. 

Up to c^3, the “time” can be described by the “rotation” of light, or the “power” of stars, described by 3.1415. 

And then onwards, the “time” will more and more describe an individual way of seeing. 

On earth, π diverts highly for individual seers (plants, insects, animals, especially humans) helping the original red seer of time achieve her mission of creating a “3 force way of seeing”. 

At the end of time, this original seer can resolve the original “court case” from looking at everything at c (creating a c^2 mirror), by proposing a final 3.1415 vision to always look at everything with. 

It gets accepted, bc the red/blue/green π mathematically stabilizes the multiverse. For example, bc of earth’s understanding of “music of the mind” and “complex multifaceted communication”, all translatable to math.

## Conclusion

3.1415 summarizes how the speed of light has been “nested” twice, and the 1 thus stands for the decision to see. Bc 4 is the “mirror of all”, the speed of light is captured 3 times.

Other documents within this project build up to this, and speculate on history based on best estimates.
