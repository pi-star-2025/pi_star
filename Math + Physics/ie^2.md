## (ie)^2

3.1415 has two “subliminal drops”, 14 and 15. 

Technically, in an ideal number system, the .1 represents an angle that describes the speed of light.

.1 is the best we can do, with 1-9 as the system.

A number system based on e is technically the best for capturing this angle. 

Bc of 14 AND 15, there are two nesting of c. We then get —- 

Blackhole teeth are like c^2

Whitehole teeth are like (ic)^2

These relationships are also captured by e^2 and (ie)^2

Both relationships are embedded in 1415, which balances out the “equal and opposite” positive and negative reactions (looking DOWN, then UP)

After 1415, the number will adjust for the differences between the 0-9 system and the e-based system. Additionally, the number will explain the “way of seeing” created by these blackhole/whitehole teeth. 

Precisely, when you factor out the 1415 whitehole/blackhole angles from pi, you can understand precisely the mass (area) added by the 3-force vision. The story of how mass is created by the Red/Blue/Green Vision is told after 3.1415.

… 

Within a given system, gravity and antigravity are thus what most bend light out of the c^2 and (ic)^2 “teeth”.

The equation for calculating the total gravity/antigravity (Time) is T = e^π / c^2

The one thing to point out is the hidden term, (ic)^2 OR (ie)^2, which is factored into this ratio, but gets embedded into π and cancelled out.

Both the UP and the DOWN vision is captured in the area of a circle.
