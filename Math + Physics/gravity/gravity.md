## Gravity / Antigravity

Special relativity helps describe 3.14 behavior, up to the c^2 mirror 

General relativity helps descibe past mirror effects into gravitational effects

... 

To understand gravity we need to understand rotation of planets is mimicking of light waves, but in a nested dimension. So it mimics c^2 behavior 

And gravity is mimicking of vision (for example of a sun), but in a nested dimension. So it mimic c^π behavior

One is with two eyes and the other is drilling in with three eyes.

And in both cases it’s truly the vision of the sun

...

Technically all objects we can see are moving towards one another to increase the pi (the length) of a star or blackhole vision - this is hot fusion.

Gravity purely is about increasing the length of a star’s pi 

This also increases the entropy/temperature of the star's vision

Cold fusion strictly decreases the pi. Which is why mastery of anti gravity is associated with heaven states.
