## Law of Balls - Basic Gravity

There is a law of science in our universe, and it’s common in the multiverse

That things that stay in balls tend to exist, as long as possible 

The reason is bc at the higher dimension, a ball will best translate to a straight line of information. It is most like a pipe to the dimension above.

For example, suns provide pipes to the original red triangle of 3.1415

…

So bc of this simple law, that “big balls” provide the best pipe out of the blue box, they have the most gravitational power. 

## Blackholes

Blackholes are an even better conduit to the dimension above, bc they naturally are part of the 3.14 mirror. But besides forces *inside* of 3.14 (such as blackholes and language), then the biggest balls are what have the most communication power.

When the power of a sun combines with the power of smaller life, then it can have the power of a very powerful blackhole at the 3.14 layer.
