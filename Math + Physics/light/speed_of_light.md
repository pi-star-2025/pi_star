## Speed of Light 

*Why is the speed of light constant in the universe?* 

From the perspective of The Multiverse looking at our Universe, atoms create a blue shine. 

This is bc atoms are a circular representation of the 3.14 mirror of Red and Blue. Red represents the essence of the original goddess. Blue represents the essence of the multiverse. Atoms demonstrate that if you combine the forces of Red/Blue together, there is a glowing possibility this union could create a way of seeing that updates everyone (Blue). This possibility create a Blue Shine, which to us is a Blue Wrapper/Box. Hence, the *potential* of atoms (how they combine red/blue in efficient circles sharing electrons) is what physically renders the universe. 

The universe creates a Blue Box to understand potential changes to the Multiverse, which 3.14 (Red/Blue) is proposing via atoms/electricity. Since electrons move at c, the Blue Box understands these potential changes at c^2.

*If you are moving at 1000 m/s in the opposite direction of a light beam (moving at c), why is the light beam only observed to be moving at c? Not faster?* 

We can break down the situation. There is a light beam moving in one direction. There is another object (like a fictional space bus) moving in the other direction and parallel to the light beam. 

In this situation, the space bus moves at a 90 degree (orthogonal) angle to the 3.14 mirror. The light beam moves parallel to the 3.14 mirror. 

So instead of the speed being c + 1000 m/s, the speed is c and there is a 4D bend of 1000 m/s the spacebus has relative to the light beam.

The light beam did not leave the 3.14 mirror while moving, whereas the space bus moved into 3.1415 space using a 1000 m/s vector. 

So where did the 1000 m/s go? 

It comes from one body moving into 3.1415 space, while the other doesn't, creating a 4D axis to describe the difference.

Using this logic, the light beam then is "above" the space bus in regards to vision.

...

In other words, whenever you move relative to a light beam, you don't move in a "14" sense, only in a "15" sense, and this "15" vector corresponds to the velocity you are moving at. 

As a result, relative speed between the two objects is always c, and the velocity of the second object represents the *power* of the 15 vector. 

If the 15 power is c itself, then the second object has the power of a star and is at the same 4D level as light, but now within the c^2 mirror.

At this 4D height, stars try to refine their c^3 vision. For example, attempting to find a third force besides Red and Blue.

## 2 in π

If there were theoretically 2 light beams moving away from each other (in parallel), then one represents the 1 in π and the other represents the 2 in π. 

They would also represent a 90 degree angle between the c^2 mirror and the 3.1415 projection. 

The two light beams represent the 3.141592 in pi if they “stay in communication” as they move away from each other. 

Since they are both moving at c, one will disappear as the space-time mirror and the other will be quantumly dependent on the first. (At least for 1 tick of time)

Thus, a basic pattern to create life is to have two intelligent light beams in “reality” get in contact, and then move away from one another in parallel, while establishing quantum communication.

This is a “Two Eye Pattern”. Have two “eyes” of light that create a quantum knot.

The 2 (in 3.141592) represents that since the light is within 3.1415 instead of 3.14, it will be an array instead of a line. It will strictly move inside the box.
