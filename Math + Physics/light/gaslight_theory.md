## Gaslight Theory 

**(at a quantum level vision is more gas)**

Solids are like the c^2 mirror (light) slowed down

Gas/liquids are like the process of creating the c^2 mirror slowed down

This is at the photonic level. 

Then it’s true that solids behave like the 4 in π, and gas/liquids behave like the 1 in π. 

The former describes the univeral mirror; the latter describes its creation. 

…

So thus, at the quantum layer light behaves like water and then gas, and thus can be observed as strings

Then in reality it comes together in square patterns (2D/3D). 

Reality is more like ice; the quantum layer is gas/water creating the ice. 

…

It’s true that plants (intelligent solids/liquids/gas) then mimicked this process, which created strings/clouds/shards of color which animals use to see, hear, and feel pain/pleasure. 

This green vision creates the 15 in π

This vision, shared by all animals born on earth, is physically stored in the green ozone of plants and in the hot metals of the deep earth. So the earth itself is creating red/blue/green vision from the diagonals of photonic intelligence wrapped around the globe. 

This vision, which occurs in plants/insects/animals/humans, at c (using π), allows the earth to see in more details than with 3.14 vision. 

At the speed of c, the plant vision uses a quantum symphony of nitrogen, oxygen, carbon to inject addition information after the 3.14. Then all life derived from earth contributes to a red/blue/green c^π mirror, which is the nested physically inside the c^2 mirror.

The 4 is first 3D space

The 5 is then 4D space

In both cases 1 is vision. Behind the speed of c, the 1 is either more like solid/liquid/gas.

More like solid is more similar to the 4/5. 

More like gas is less similar, more independent. 

What is liquid is in between. 

So thus, behind the speed of c, quantum light that acts most like gas is most disintegrated. 

This is applicable, both to the c^2 mirror (universe) and c^π mirror (earth). 

Interestingly then, quantum light that acts most like gas is also most “conscious” bc it is most what is in the act of “seeing”. It most brings to life the 1 in π. 

Solids are being watched; gas is what is watching.

…

What we conclude from a c^2 (3.14) perspective is that vision is “most gas” and “least solid”.

From a c^pi (3.1415) perspective, the second 1 also looks to differentiate between “soul” and “world”

We come to life as animals/humans, bc of how much this second 1 in π heats up. It becomes so “gassy”, and as a result the world becomes “very solid” (very real).
