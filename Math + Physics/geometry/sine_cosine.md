## Sine and Cosine

Euler’s identity reveals that there are 2 sides to π.

Whereas e represents the speed of light - the maximum speed within a 3D space -  π represents how in a 4D space (because of equal/opposite reactions that stay in sync), the 2 angles (equal and opposite) of a beam of light create additional potential. 

e assumes that light has a 90 degree angle always to original space/time. π considers all possibles angles (sine/cosine) a given beam of a light could have relative to space/time.

Hence, π is exactly like e, but considering all angles (all sine/cosine combinations).

Thus, e is the best representation of the speed of light, whereas π describes, as you go down the number, all the possible angle combinations in the universe. These angle combinations create the diagonals of shapes. The sharper the angles, the more complex shapes the universe can have. The angles are shaper and sharper as you go down π.

The hypotenuse in sine/cosine represents the speed of light, as though the light was traveling in a straight line (90 degrees) without creating time through equal/opposite reactions. Then the opposite/adjacent angles of sine/cosine are the *2* reactions of a light beam, which can be used by atoms then elements and molecules to reference angles down π. 

These angles down π don't only stay in sync with the speed of light (e) and sine/cosine triangle geometry, but also reference the same angles used by all other universes of the multiverses, to wake up vision. Meaning e describes mathematical focus, whereas π describes vision.
