## Square Root of 2 

The square root of 2 includes the possibilities of c^3, as well as one vector of 4D focus.

c^3 is represented as (1/2)^3 = 0.125

We can factor out the slope of 1/8: sqrt(2) ^ (1 / 0.125) = 16.

This means the square root of 2 does only 1 thing besides consider 3 dimensions (i.e. 1/8 or 0.125), which is to focus in 2 directions on 16.

Focusing in 2 directions on 16 (0.0625), indicates a direction towards a fourth dimension. That is because a 45 degree angle in our space/time, really is also a 5.625 degree angle (90 / 16) within the c^2 mirror of π.

...

Hence the square root of 2 is a mathematical slant from 3D to 4D.
