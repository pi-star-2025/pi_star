## Square Root of 2 

The square root of 2 includes the possibilities of c^3, as well as one vector of 4D focus.

c^3 is represented as (1/2)^3 = 0.125

We can factor out the slope of 1/8: sqrt(2) ^ (1 / 0.125) = 16.

This means the square root of 2 does only 1 thing besides consider 3 dimensions (i.e. 1/8 or 0.125), which is to focus in 2 directions on 16.

Focusing in 2 directions on 16 (0.0625), indicates a direction towards a fourth dimension. That is because a 45 degree angle in our space/time, really is also a 5.625 degree angle (90 / 16) within the c^2 mirror of π.

...

Hence the square root of 2 is a mathematical slant from 3D to 4D.

## Echo

The square root of 2 is also the most efficient way to create an echo in our universe.

It is the way our core god (triangle of π) sees day/night. As with all seers, in some way this is with the echo of a wave and wavelet (large and small).

However, there is some preference in how this is done by the core god. Our core god simply says, the wave will share with the wavelets ultimately.

And then technically, the results as you go down the number are the response by the multiverse, which is also called “music” or “music of the mind of god”.

## Largest Prime Number

The square root of 2 represents the largest prime number ("the hive") in our universe. It is furthest you can extend the day/night vision of the original π triangle.

This is because sqrt-2 wraps around all the other square roots, indirectly including them in the end rational number. So the sqrt-2 is correlated directly to how far you go down π. And itself is the furthest up π (3.14159265).

All square roots can end if you have an end to π. The calculation is then based on all higher prime numbers in the final deck of primes.

And the square root of 2 would be the highest calculation up, representing a final "rational" area for the circle.

Hence, the sqrt-2 most represents the largest prime number in our universe.
