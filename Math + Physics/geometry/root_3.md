## Root 3 within π

After 3.1415 of π, light moves in a straight line down 3.141592.

It then creates time by "seeing" the square roots of ascending prime numbers.

We can observe the square root of 2 as 92/65 (from 3.1419265), which is an approximation with 2 digits of a 45-45-90 degree triangle.

We can observe the square root of 3 as 926/535, which is an approximation with 3 digits of a 30-60-90 triangle. The 535 of 3.1415926535 also needs to integrate with the 92/65 45-45-90 triangle, so includes it in its "vision".
