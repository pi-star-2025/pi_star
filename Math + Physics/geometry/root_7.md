## Root 7

The sqrt(2) is referenced x5 going straight down .1415 of π ((0.7071067)/(.1415) ≈ 5,). The sqrt(2) is also referenced as initiating the next curve (92/65 ≈ 1.41).

The sqrt(3) is referenced curving one tick further (926/535 ≈ 1.73).

If light were to move in a perfectly straight line, with 0 physical matter (i.e. Time), then the light would move at e * 1.25 from 3.14 of π.

The c^2 mirror (with 4 sides) then perfectly follows this beam of light.

Within π, the curve of e * 1.25 is best represented by (e-2) * 1.25, or ≈ .8979.

This curve ((e-2) * 1.25)) explains the "9" of 3.14159, which creates the movement for understanding sqrt(5). It is a single straight move by the light beam.

In addition, this curve ((e-2) * 1.25)) explains the 8979 of 3.14159265358979, which creates an additional straight movement of light, correlated to the sqrt(7).

The sqrt(7) is when you already have a spark of life from sqrt(5), and with this spark of life, sqrt(7) applies pressure in one direction.

Within a shining vision (sqrt-5), the sqrt-7 sees one direction it wants to move in.
