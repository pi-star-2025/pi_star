## Root 5 within π.

When the universe started, the triangle reflected light in 5 directions with 3.1415 starlight.

The next angle possible is sqrt-2, ≈ 92/65 of 3.14159265.

After, the next angle possible is sqrt-3, ≈ 926/535 of 3.1415926535.

The angle of the square root of 2 (going through 9265) is explicitly 5x the angle of π (.14159265). (0.7071067)/(.14159265) ≈ 5, which indicates a slope of 5 from 3.1415 going straight through 3.1415926535. This wraps around both the square root of 2 and 3, via a 3-4-5 90 degree triangle.

So it's hypothesized the square roots of 2/3/5 can all be referenced via 3.1415926535.

...

As you go further down π, sqrt(2)/sqrt(3)/sqrt(5) keep impacting the numbers if they can express the curves of the roots.

The sqrt(5)/3.1415926535 in our universe points to what "shines". Whereas the sqrt(2) is most Red, the sqrt(3) is most Blue, the sqrt(5) is most Yellow. This can be referenced by a streak of lightening, a "spark" of life in the ocean, or indirectly by the green of plants.
