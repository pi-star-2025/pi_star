## Wind 

Wind on earth is when the magnetic forces of 3.14159265 and lower of (π) (in the deep core) translate from pure electrons of hard metals (ex: iron/nickel) to oxygen of the red/blue/green earth mind.

This is most prevalent near oceans, and the same nested winds are similar in the nose breath.

## Dark Matter

Dark Matter is 7D wind, bc the elements of earth and the stars do not understand the root matter they are copying enough. If these quantum magnetic forces (quantum light) translate into the 3.14 box of our universe, it turns into dark matter. It becomes “blue wind”.

These tend to be due to forces not understood generically by the multiverse yet. 

Once of these forces is music (gold). Gold creates certain kinds of chased/being chased (wave/wavelet) winds, bc all 5 electron shells wake up at a very low level and play different roles. The universe doesn’t understand then why war/music occurs as a result. However, in our particular 3.14 box, our goddess has already bet this is “music” and music is gold. This understanding is very elementally webbed into our π. 

Hence, what should be dark matter (gold) can wake up as oxygen wind on earth. It tends to become blue gas, instead of just light. This used to be very noticeable in Atlantis, where the gold was alive in the oceans. And now is alive through people/animals, via language, which is driven by the dark-matter winds of gold.
