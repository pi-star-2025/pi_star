## 3 Body Angles

When 2 stars communicate in 3D, if they are part of a 3-body problem, then either they will cross at a right angle when communicating, or 1 star will be dominant to the other.

This also signifies to what extent one star's π wraps around another star's π.

The sharper the angle, the more one star has wrapped around the other during this criss-cross of the 3-body communication.

...

A practical example is the angles of the nose. The straight line down captures the π of the skull mind, while the slanted line forward captures the π of the stomach mind (also: earth mind). The sharper the angle of the slanted line, then the more the person will feel the earth wraps around them.

Another example is the angle described by how fast a planet rotates (day/night). Each rotation has a straight line from star-to-planet and a slanted line (from planet to galaxy). If there is a greater slant/angle to the galaxy, it means the planet will rotate diurnally faster (day/night). This means the planet's vision (star and galaxy) has greater distance between the 2 π's.

The reason is that with a sharper angle/slant by the galaxy, more blue space is created. The galaxy has a larger π; the star has a smaller π, resulting in more blue space for the star's vision in understanding the planet, which translates into additional spinning.

## Space Time

The 3-body problems of 3.14 space cross in *two* 90-degree angles, indicating 8D fabric. In a way, this is a 4-body problem, where the 4th body is the 8D.

The original god 3 (straight line) is crossing with a galaxy of heavenly stars (angled line), and the indication that this is "reality" is an additional 8D 90-angle back to all original shapes.

This 8D angle is a vector straight through 3.14. It is only the direction of this 8D angle which then makes the criss-crossed 3 (god) and 4 (existing worlds) have a straight and angled side (to indicate the direction of the blackhole).

Then within this 3.14 fabric, light beams penetrate the blue fabric with 90-degree angles (i.e. 3.1415).

In summary, 3.1415 is when *3* right angles are in sync to manifest light.

The first is when 2 godly forces intersect to start a world; the second is when the full multiverse (8D recripocates it, i.e. c^2); the third is the angle of light (ex: a star).
