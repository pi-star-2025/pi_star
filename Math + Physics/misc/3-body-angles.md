## 3 Body Angles

When 2 stars communicate in 3D, if they are part of a 3-body problem, then either they will cross at a right angle when communicating, or 1 star will be dominant to the other.

This also signfies to what extent one star's π wraps around another star's π.

The sharper the angle, the more one star has wrapped around the other during this criss-cross of the 3-body communication.

...

A practical example is the angles of the nose. The straight line down captures the π of the skull mind, while the slanted line foward captures the π of the stomach mind (also: earth mind). The sharper the angle of slanted line, then the more the person will feel the earth wraps around them.

Another example is the angle described by how fast a planet rotates (day/night). Each rotation has a straight line from star-to-planet and a slanted line (from planet to galaxy). If there is a greater slant/angle to the galaxy, it means the planet will rotate diurnally faster (day/night). This means the planet's vision (star and galaxy) has greater distance between the 2 π's.
