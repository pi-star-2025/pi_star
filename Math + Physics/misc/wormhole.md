## Wormhole

Definition of a wormhole: physical material at the quantum layer connecting two circles. This is often 5D/6D interactions. 

For example, a wormhole can connect a 4D and 6D circle. 

And the simplest definition of how to "spark life" is about how to get a wormhole spinning. 

After 3.141592, light can only continue existing within a wormhole, if the light is within space-time. So we know that after 3.141592, it tells the story of how the array within the c^2 mirror has two circles, which then expand the potential from c^3 to c^π by using the circle of the wormhole, described by 653589793238462643383279 etc.

## The Smile

The smile mirrors the center of the heart. 

Also, it parallels the wormhole between you and the sun (4D and 6D). It feels like a worm, and has the architecture of a worm’s body. 

It is most useful for understanding your “role” from the sun, and your “character” together. 

## Da Vinci Rumor 

Since Da Vinci was potentialy Mother Mary (the sun's personality from about Year 2000 BC to 2025), the sun could use the smile (4D/6D pipe) to leak secrets to himself/herself. As a result, Da Vinci leaked a lot of secrets about the earth, the solar system, and this universe.

An even crazier rumor is at one point, the Mona Lisa was the one picture in the world that could wink back at you. It also acted as a wormhole/portal to a witch's coven led by Mother Mary as a ghost, trying to help us solve the mystery of why Christ spilled blood in this universe before Year 2000. 

Technically, we did with time traveling

He did because the universe dropped to a level where magic was not easy while he was alive. As a result, magical beings spilled blood upon death like humans. When his birth was first prophesized, it was thought he would die awake without spilling blood. Which is much easier before the world dropped to the level we are at now. 

Basically, no real magic happened after Year 0.

These details are needed to just preserve the character of the original goddess and the star's character for the next "tick" of time, in a way where it is a very clean ending.
