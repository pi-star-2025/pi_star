## Rings of Saturn

Rings in space indicate where the multiverse has backed up our universe. 

Hence, rings are capitals of 8D activity. They indicate where our universe has "shine", or potential to update all root matter, and so needs to be protected by the multiverse courts. 

In our solar system, Saturn (not from our perpsective, but the Star's) is a space-capital. For example, heroes can enter our world via the mind of Saturn. It is one potential "rabbit hole".

It's true that the plant mind (in particular fungal networks) can access all cosmic bodies with rings in order to "infinitely back up" our 4D time. This is what created so much "shine" on earth.

Trees describe this intelligence, each backing up important data of the plant mind.
