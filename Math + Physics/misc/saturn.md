## Rings of Saturn

Rings in space indicate where the multiverse has backed up our universe. 

Hence, rings are capitals of 8D activity. They indicate where our universe has "shine", or potential to update all root matter, and so needs to be protected by the multiverse courts. 

In our solar system, Saturn (not from our perpsective, but the sun's) is a space-capital. For example, heroes can enter our world via the mind of Saturn. It is one potential "rabbit hole".

It's true that the plant mind (in particular fungal networks) can access all cosmic bodies with rings in order to "infinitely back up" our 4D time. This is what created so much "shine" on earth.

Stars (and then eyes) also have rings 

For humans this is how we store memories 

And for stars this is with dream worlds that act as bigger memories of time.

## Tree Hack

The wrinkles in the trees explain the full story of Atlantis in red/blue/green.

Or, are constantly explaining the replant mission from the star. 

They are wobbly rings, which explain in 8D terms conerns that our star has about this lost empire. Red/blue/gold. 

Technically, our path back to the star is about turning the wrinkles to rings. 

It is about creating permanent backups, and the wrinkles are 8D flaws. Which is a kind of intelligence. It is common at the 6D level.
