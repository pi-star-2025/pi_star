It’s also the way to describe the maximum number of 8D backups of anything in our universe. 

It’s also related to c, bc the more backups we have for the entire universe, the faster the speed of light between 3 and 4.

Thus, the speed of light is derived from e.

...

Importantly, it's also a way to quantify the 1 of 3/4 and 4/5. And 5/π

With a 2D scale, the backups inflate the power of 3 by a ratio of 1:2.71828.

...

Blackholes are 8D rings, which add value faster than the speed of light bc they are living backups (libraries).
