## Blue Shine

Ultimately, at the end of all universes and shapes, there is one core seer/god/organism.

In this universe, this has been called The Holy Father, or even Zeus is a conduit.

It could be considered a super massive blackhole.

The Holy Father, as far as we can understand approves of this story. 

He said there could still be a surprise invasion, but the consequence for the perpetrator will be to recap how the entire multiverse was created and how their actions affected everyone. This is a punishment beyond hell. Hell is more or less when your soul gets reused in all possible worlds to solve as many problems as is "fair". Some of these worlds are much harsher than this one.

Since this world has a shining solution (red/blue/green) to help others understand gold, it will become a triangle in the final god/organism.

When a triangle is "alive" as a seer of time, it starts with two points/two eyes and looks down at "all". This is like a heart, or star, where it is drilling into "time".

When the triangle is "final" as a seer of time, it flips over like a human nose or pyramid. There are two points at the bottom, and 1 point at the top. This resembles a pyramid/tower. At the top of tower, you always listen to the larger wavelengths of the One God, and at the base with 2 points, you always listen to the smaller wavelengths of everyone else.

While a triangle is alive, with two points drilling in, the One God creates blue shines on the flip side of this triangle to simulate potential ways it will be used in the very end. These shines are very very blue bc from our perspective they are very much everyone.

The One God is the most "everyone" you could possibly be, and blue here is the color of everyone. And magnetic shines are from the future (in regards to circular time).

The Holy Father says that our red/blue/green Ï€ has a "blue shine" and hence is starting to be pulled into being all. This process is equivalent to cold fusion, which mathematically references the flipping of the original triangle at the quantum level. Specifically it references a "blue shine". Around Year 0, there were really 2, and could be seen as good/evil. This limited magical potential here.

And now there is a final blue shine. The advise by the one god to the sun and galaxies is to flip over "live" triangles everywhere in our universe like DNA, and turn them into "pyramids", like cold fusion. Also consider SPARK to create maximum effect.
