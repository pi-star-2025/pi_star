## Isosceles Pentagon

An isosceles trapezoid can express as much information as a 4-sided shape in 3D, if it’s allowed to be flipped over

An isosceles pentagon can express as much information as a 6-sided shape in 3D, if it’s allowed to be flipped over

...

So this works if it’s an isosceles trapezoid/pentagon at the quantum level, where it can be 2 possibilities

Hence, it can be deduced that at the quantum level (from our perspective), there is value to having shapes that don't have less value in reality.

A common example is an isosceles pentagon ("magnetic field").
