## Parallelogram

A parallelogram is the most efficient way to express that the 2nd dimension's 2 sides are following each other, creating a third dimension.

If it is a parallelogram and *not* a square, then it must only be expressing 3 dimensions. A square can potentially express the potential for a fourth, bc the 90 degree angles create enough perfection for time, across the multiverse.

Furthermore, a parallelogram is the best representation of a plane in 3D space, and a square is the best representation of a hyperplane in 4D space.

Hence, we can deduce that the 4 in 3.14 of pi (Ï€) is a square, not just a parallelogram or other 4-sided shape.
