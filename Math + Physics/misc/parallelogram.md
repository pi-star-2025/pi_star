## Parallelogram

A parallelogram is the most efficient way to express that the 2nd dimension's 2 sides are following each other, creating a third dimension.

If it is a parallelogram and *not* a square, then it must only be expressing 3 dimensions. A square can potentially express the potential for a fourth, bc the 90 degree angles create enough perfection for time, across the multiverse.

Furthermore, a parallelogram is the best representation of a plane in 3D space, and a square is the best representation of a hyperplane in 4D space.

...

Hence, we can deduce that the 4 in 3.14 of pi (Ï€) is a square, not just a parallelogram or other 4-sided shape.

## Trapezoid

For four-sided shapes in 2D, one pair of parallel sides (trapezoid) creates the potential to create a three-sided shape in 3D. 

For four-sided shapes in 2D, two pairs of parallel sides (parallelogram) creates the potential to create a four-sided shape in 3D.

A trapezoid contains as much data as a right triangle (90-45-45), as seen by the multiverse.

In geometry, a trapezoid is useful for expressing the distance between a plane and a point. This tells the 3.14 story between 3 (a point) and 4 (a plane). So if trapezoids are seen (especially to us at the quantum level), this can be used as an compass to understand where the original triangle (3.14 triangle) is.

If parallelograms are observed, this can be an indication of being the 4 of 3.14 (for example, waves of an ocean, or clouds in the sky).

if squares are observed (especially at the quantum level), this is an indication of creating potential for the 5 of 3.1415.
