## Number System Adjustments 

π is a way to translate any square to a circle 

The number is ideal based on our number system, w/ 0-9

The 1 of 14 and 15 is the “best” we can do to keep the 3/4/5 in balance when translating the square to a circle 

Really, the 1 should be a number that represents the fall of the speed of light. e is a number that can be used to create such a number system

As a result, a good deal of π is adjusting for how our number system is not perfectly in sync with the speed of light.

The number π indicates that the fall from 3 to .1 is like 30:1. Really it should be much greater

3.000014 is not the way to make the fall greater, though it might look like it. 3.14 is the best estimate for the area, bc it indicates the sharpest angle possible between the "3" and "4"

The rest of pi will adjust for .1 being the sharpest angle, instead of a number that is as sharp as the speed of light. 


…

It also explains why we only see 3 around the circle. The 1 is invisible due to *vision*

The slope is always 90 degrees, tangential to the center at every point of the circle 

It’s bc the 1 of 14 and 15 should really be indicating a much bigger drop.

The first 1 is a drop exactly as fast as the speed of light and would be a super sharp angle. 

Technically, it would be an angle (slope) that to us had 4D qualities, bc it was as sharp as c. 

Since this angle doesn't exist in our "human experience", our "human vision", we don't see it. 

The star would see it as a "hole" to start looking into, which creates time. 

….

It’s also true that 3.1415 is much like a number that other universes would come up with to understand their own times 

It wouldn’t necessarily be perfect 

But also have cartoonish simplifications to indicate they are part of nested vision and vision systems

For example 1 (from 1-10) instead of e/c indicates “cartoonish simplification” indicating we are part of a nested vision

Euler's identity, in particular captures this. How in a number system perfectly blended with star vision, we would use e as a base.
