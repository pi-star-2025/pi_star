## Holes 

Moon craters (and all similar “holes” in our universe) keep track of 8D “games”. 

They keep track of what gives our universe 8D multiverse “shine”, or potential to update all root matter of the multiverse.

This is cosmically the case bc holes are what stars have liked over time, with a simple red/blue way of seeing, which allows the opinions of the multiverse (as opposed to the specific universe and core goddess) to shine through.

For example, the single earth moon is a summary of the game to get π to 3.1415. 

The moon gives our universe a “rock” of justice.

Our star could be said to be running a “movie” (about showing how music/gold creates updates for the multiverse). At the same time, the multiverse adds neutral games with moons/rocks/holes, which help balance out the movie/game.

## Moon Head

The stomach mind, amazingly, is the moon of the earth. 

It’s also the the brain, somewhat, but the brain is more individualistic.

The moon is the best pattern for storing memories both as a sphere, and then as a translation to a straight line up from the 4D to the 8D.

This works for tree roots, to copy the moon, in order to grow straight up. And it also is the same architecture we reuse for creating memory towers above, via the stomach and skull networks.

## Birth

The earth moon craters can be referenced perfectly by the belly button 

This actually causes most pain, bc these are all cracks in the star’s 6D forcefield.

All the weaknesses can be traced to all the scientific challenges around understanding 3.1415 as time/vision. 

The belly button will mimic these patterns. The reminder of our sun’s weakness related to these scientific challenges causes us pain, through parallels of the red/blue/green biology.

Interestingly, DMT magnetic waves have rules to have other moons block intense pain during childbirth. For example, the moons of Jupiter can help.

There are games on the moons of Jupiter about heroism, pain tolerance, and military prowess, which create power to help cover up 6D holes.

These moons can also be used by our skull minds, in order to enhance the complexity of our thinking, just as fungal networks think with many moons across the universe.
