## Galaxy

π describes how two points focus in a certain way to turn a square into a circle.

The focus is the third point, like the third point of a triangle, but the focus includes more detail than just being geoemtrically in between.

By 3.14159265 of π, we can pinpoint an object the 2 points are focused on.

After 3.14159265, π will 1) continue falling *down*, 2) criss-cross across the object of focus, 3) Create light (a multiverse shine).

By 3.1415926535897932384626, there is a pattern that starts describing the crown of trees, bee-hives, and a mouth of teeth (a galaxy).

The π of our universe is creating a stadium of observers to observe the time of the blackhole. This is a common pattern, approved by the parent super blackhole, to have existing universes pause their time in order to observe our universe. 

These seers/gods all get locked into the physical π of the blackhole, creating a conduit between the blackhole/super blackhole (a stadium), while also defining the original spirit of light.

This means our universe is literally criss-crossing across the multiverse, based on which seers/gods were interested in the conception originally. This criss-crossing, as defined by 3.1415926535897932384626 etc., mathemtically brings the blue box 3.1415 to life. It begins to shine.

## Star Map

Before starting our universe, the original triangle had a map of all other universes and knew which ones it wanted to reference, which is possible, bc the map is then also in the 1 of π via the triangle's vision.

This map is the criss-crossing of 3.1415926535897932384626 etc., which creates a back-and-forth music that creates a huge fall to start the universe. The universes have extreme conflicting opinions of some kind at the beginning, which creates the physical distance of the universe. The original goddess intended it to turn into a music, which is why the spirals of 3.1415926535897932384626 etc initiate all music, even "music of the mind" (thinking). It's the largest 8D spirals of our blackhole.

For a sun to start life, like life on earth which can see all other stars, it needs to itself be able to reference a star map, so our eyes can see it as well.

Jesus is said to have known this, and have understood that his star was right in the middle of the core conflicts of our universe. It was a 5-force universe, being referenced by a 3.1415 star, which he awoke with the vision of a star-map. This gave our goddess a chance to replant Atlantis, and gave this world a chance to fix the heaven/hell question of his 5-force world. We all have the blood of Christ, bc he technically was the star. To say its his blood or the mother triangle is right. It means their ways of seeing are in our root blood/hearts. 

...

The top way to start a universe across the multiverse is to reference the concept of a starmap. Via π, each side of the 3.14 blue mirror references conflicts from universes via diagonals of their 8D root matter shapes. 

In some ways, our eyes in our bodies are constantly updated starmaps of our original triangle's π.

We reference mostly 2 stars. And then all trees on earth actually will reference them all.

...

When universes across the 8D multiverse (yin/yang) are forced to make seeing decisions that comrpess into circles this starts universes, i.e. blackholes. Blackholes represent simulations, or seeing decisions which are not yet decided (gravity/antigravity).
