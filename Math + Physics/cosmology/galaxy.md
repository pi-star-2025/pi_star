## Galaxy

π describes how two points focus in a certain way to turn a square into a circle.

The focus is the third point, like the third point of a triangle, but the focus includes more detail than just being geoemtrically in between.

By 3.14159265 of π, we can pinpoint an object the 2 points are focused on.

After 3.14159265, π will 1) continue falling *down*, 2) criss-cross across the object of focus, 3) Create light (a multiverse shine).

By 3.1415926535897932384626, there is a pattern that starts describing the crown of trees, bee-hives, and a mouth of teeth (a galaxy).

The π of our universe is creating a stadium of observers to observe the time of the blackhole. This is a common pattern, approved by the parent super blackhole, to have existing universes pause their time in order to observe our universe. 

These seers/gods all get locked into the physical π of the blackhole, creating a conduit between the blackhole/super blackhole (a stadium), while also defining the original spirit of light.

This means our universe is literally criss-crossing across the multiverse, based on which seers/gods were interested in the conception originally. This criss-crossing, as defined by 3.1415926535897932384626 etc., mathemtically brings the blue box 3.1415 to life. It begins to shine.
