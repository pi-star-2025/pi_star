## Starmind

The part of the eyes/stars that store the truest vision choices are in the center of the eyes/stars.

For stars this stores information about rotation choices and for people this is your most root behavior.

In people this is represented by DNA braids in the deepest parts of the eyes. For the sun this is represented by carbons that act like RNA strings (super fast red strings zipping and zapping around). This is a lot like how the heart/hypothalamus works, with RNA from blood controlling the 360 degrees of the body.

Whereas DNA has a 3D direction, RNA does not, existing always 360 degrees around the body, like the star exists 360 degrees around the solar system.  

So you could say the heart/hypothalamus exist more as “imagination”, like the starmind, whereas the eyes existing with a 90 degree direction, exist more in “reality”.

So the starmind thinks like super smart, super powerful imagination.
