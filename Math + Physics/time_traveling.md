*QUESTION:*

There are two essential kinds of vision: 1) a cool magnetic shine, 2) hot gas 

Why is it said that 2) is watching 1) -> why is one kind of vision watching another? 

It’s bc hotter (gassier) vision watches colder (magnetic) vision. 

This is bc the magnetic shine is relatively from the future, and what is the past watches the future. 

This is actually the flow of time, the direction of time. It always goes from hot vision to cool vision. (Larger pi -> Smaller pi)

So technically, really changing time would involve returning souls to a state of “hotter vision” and then redoing the transition to “cooler vision”, in a way that was accepted by the multiverse.

This happened in a 5-force world, very similar to ours, where Jesus was then on a mission in a very hot desert environment to understand he had changed time. It was like a wasteland of hot souls, seemingly with all their time fried; however, it was actually due to time traveling, so that instead of Hell for that world, it could transition in a different way to a state of “cooler vision”. 

In our 3-force earth world we didn’t time travel the same way, however we do in our “heaven”, where “cooler” angels of us live from the future. This is possible, bc we are directly the hotter vision of the angels, with our time cooling off and flowing directly to their world.
