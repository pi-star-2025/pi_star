## Euler's Number

The constant e (Euler's Number) stands for a orthogonal slope, relative to pi.

For example, it describes the 1 in pi (*1*4 and *1*5 of 3.1415). 

In a 4D context, Euler's Number is really 1. In a 3D context, it describes exactly what a 4D "1" is. 2.71828... is the translation.


## Big E and Small e

mc^2 = e^π

The catch here is that e is the 3D numerical translation of the speed of light

c is the 4D translation 

This is more or less indicating how much “mass” is being watched. The act of watching and being watched (“seeing”) creates the mass. 

The story of the vision is encoded in pi, while the numerical result (life created) is indicated via m.

... 

When you combine these 3D and 4D concepts, you get

m = e^π / c^2 

Or T = e^π / c^2 

Bc it indicates how much additional space you created bc of organizing yourself with the intent to “see”

Instead of a 4D number like meters/second, it’s kind of a negative 4D number like seconds/meter, describing how to create gravity and anti-gravity. 

Or how to create *seconds*, from a finite 3D space.

## Golden Ratio φ

The contributions of pi to T are about pi / 2. 1.571 is the “straight line” approximation of how much mass is inflated. 

The Golden Ratio (1.618) is closer to the “circular” value, the full value. As you spiral further and further out with the Fibonacci sequence, you get closer to ratios of ~ 1.618 (φ).

2 / 1 = 2

3 / 2 = 1.5

5 / 3 = 1.666

8 / 5 = 1.6 

13 / 8 = 1.625

Etc. 

The matter in our universe is approximately 1.618x “inflated” purely due to vision. This 1.618-matter tends to shine like golden sunlight, indicating which matter is most alive and being watched. 

This 1.618-inflation due to vision can be traced to specific mass, such as galaxies, solar systems, stars, planets, and life. Whatever parallels the number pi the most. The actual number of pi will be longer and thus more complex and entropic for life that is more conscious.

The more the “Mind of God” masters what exactly is creating this gold, the more it can become recycled and create the same m in *m = e^π / c^2*, but with a pi that is as short as possible. 

So in a way, humans were here to live with a very long, drilled-in pi and understand what exactly the m in our universe is (what is really creating the gold). And then our God (our star) can understand “the music of the angels” and do the same things with a smaller (shorter) pi.

This is the best of Yin/Yang in regards to balancing *T = e^π / c^2*

The first term mc^2 is like the 3D calculation of space, based on 2 forces 

The second term e^π is like the 4D calculation of space based on 3 forces 

## Theory of Everything (T)

*T = e^π / c^2*

mc^2 is actual energy

e^π is quantum energy of the entity with three forces - like the star/earth 

Mass (m) is everything in the universe affected by gravity/antigravity. The creation of mass as a result of mc^2 staying in balance with e^π is time (T).

Since it helps us understand the mission of our goddess (the star/mother earth) to find three forces, it’s a basic Theory of Everything

Bc all 3D mass (m) that we see and all 4D time (T) that we experience is created by this way of seeing (π) with three forces.
