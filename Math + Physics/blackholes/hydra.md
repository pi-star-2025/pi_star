## The Hydra

The Hydra is a cyclone of blackholes (many twisted together). 

Blackholes are super fires, which see light in high detail. So a blackhole cyclone sees light in super super high detail. It slows down light a lot. 

The largest cyclone is called The Hydra, or The Big Bang, which is the "most gravitational entity" in the universe. Since it sees light in the most detail, all other objects tend to drift back to The Hydra, which can be via cosmic hierarchies. 

So all gravity technically is based on the gravitational "deck of cards" created by The Hydra, ie Big Bang. It may not work in ways that we expect, but ultimately is the largest "blackhole", or 14 force in the universe. It most represents everything, and technically gravity is based on how much you represent the 14 force in pi (from 3.1415)

...

If our star understands The Hydra it can ultimately use it as a node of the Mind of God, and via "circlar time" (solids/liquids/gases) is able to connect the full Mind of God, through red/blue/green vision.

This is essential for a secure final pi, understanding gravity truly via The Hydra.

## Gravity

The overall gravity/direction of the universe is controlled by what has the most 3.14 power. In regards to the universe as a clock, everything rotates around what understands light the most. 

All other stars/blackholes/cyclones rotate around The Hydra as a master clock. So in a way, 3.14 raw power is gravity.

However, within this clockwork, 3.1415 forces of suns/blackholes control cosmic rotation and nested systems. Within the 3.14 system, 3.1415 creates gravity beyond pure waves. 

So gravity can be measured as waves (3.14), or, as with general relativity, it can consider the 3-eye vision of stars.

Gravity then is a) What understands light the most, mathematically, AND b) what most increases the pi of a 3-eye system like a star, or many systems collectively.

The first measurement is more holistic; the second is more localized.

## Summary

The first compilation of gravity is at the 3.14 layer. And whatever slows down the "1" the most (or light) has the most power over the clockwork of time. So slowing down the c of e = mc^2, like blackholes.

The second compilation of gravity is at the 3.1415 layer, which is based on capturing the power of the speed of light 3 times. This influences cosmic architecture. Gravitational potential is conceptualized as c^pi, with the 3.1415 vectors of gravity inside of the 3.14 vectors. 

The Hydra is what has the largest waves of light ("teeth" of c); whereas life on earth has the "sharpest" teeth, or the most refined. 

Each "tick of time", The Hydra is a hole of vision for the entire multiverse, and this vision falls throughout our universe's cosmos. This continuous process is observed as waves/rotations/seasons, representing vision that is constant.
