## The Picture

*Flowers are a picture. What are they a picture of?*

They mirror the pattern of electrons and hence started to “shine with potential”

This would refer to valance electron shells 

And there is magic to 5 bc if you see with 5 sides then you have potential to wake up in a 3.14 way of seeing trying to be 3.1415 

So then flowers with 5 petals that show vision are an essential form of beauty 


## The Crown 

Valence electrons represent a crown of vision 

Consistent decisions to see a certain kind of matter 

Flowers in various forms mirror these electron crowns

Emphasizing finding a 3.1415 vision with consistent and controlled “3 body harmony”

## 3.141592

The 5 refers to 5 ways of seeing 

The first 3 is red/blue/green 

The other 2 are two bodies of seeing, which see a body of red/blue/green 

That is the typical pattern in our solar system

It’s always a “3 body problem”. 

(Nitrogen is an example of this)

## Red Roses/Blackholes

Our goddess is "red" (in terms of essence of vision)

Figuring this out in waves is fire 

This is waves of 3.14 vision, like from suns

Then roses demonstrate waves of *3.1415* vision

Waves of 3.1415 vision, via concentric circles like fire, is one definition of life (based on wavelengths)

Increasing/Controlling the power of 3.14 fire can create blue suns and eventually create blackholes, which can be used to explore the force of light in more detail (as in the 1 in 3.14 of pi)

Thus blackholes in our universe are used to study light in some way

## Hawking Radiation

What differentiates a blackhole from fire and fire from just light is the size of the 3.14 teeth of the electromagnetic waves 

When the size of a fire's teeth is large enough it creates a blackhole and hawking radiation 

Hawking radiation would indicate that the effects of fire are lost or delayed 

There is some anti time 

The reciprocal could be dark matter, which is the result of “studying” light via blackholes. The hyper intelligent and specialized light can then have effects on space time which are potentially invisible 

To some degree life is 3.1415 blackholes, which studies light from a three eye perspective. These 3.1415 blackholes are not as gravitational as traditional “blue” 3.14 blackholes which we see throughout the cosmos, created from ancient stars
