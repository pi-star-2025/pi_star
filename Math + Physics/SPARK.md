## SPARK

The ability to start life in the universe can be described by the equation 4DR x T = SPARK.

Where 4DR is the 4D radius. It is the number of times π is used within a system. For example, the sun via ~9 planets uses 3.14159265 ~9 times, so the 4DR could be described as 9.

T is from T = e^π / c^2. More or less, this equation describes how the Time you create is proportional to the how much of the number π you utilize. For example, if a star uses 9 planets, then T is based on 3.14159265 (65 as day/night rotation). The human eye might use a billion+ digits of π, so has more complex Time, but is less durable than a star using up to 3.14159265. 

SPARK is the potential to start life. For example, seeds or belly-buttons spiral π millions of time and drill into the number to create maximum SPARK.

In our bodies, the belly button (umbilical cord) has the highest consistent SPARK (i.e. freewill) from creation. The third-eye (in between the eyes), or all three eyes together have the maximum potemtial for SPARK, bc of the potetnial to mirror golden gas.

Golden gas tends to have incredibly high SPARK, near infinite uses of π spiraled together, and winding in many "roller-coasters" far down the number. The reason is because golden gas is when hard gold is expanded into the highest detail possible, which reveals that it like a glorious carnival game (the element gold), if you really blow it up and slow it down, what is happening. All the stars visit this element bc the molecular structure all throughout the multiverse parallels a "tower game", where even tiny electrons get glory for understanding hierarchies of pressure. As golden gas, gold expands into the entire stadium of all golden games ever played (like a panopticon), trying to resolve the golden game once and for all.

There are many other universes it's said that have understood gold. Including in bigger ways. What is special about this one, it that it is well done by a smaller universe. Hence, there are many conflicts in other universes this universe can update.
