## Proving Root 2 is connected to π

3.1415926 is a 1/7 slope slowed down.

.141592 / (1/7) = .991144

.991144 (a blackhole constant) represents 1/7 slowed down into a small and large part

If this slowing down of 1/7 is done twice in a 2D space, the resulting vector is divisible by the sqrt(2), proving the sqrt(2) is directly connected to π and 1/7.

(sqrt(.991144^2 + .991144^2))/sqrt(2) = .991144
