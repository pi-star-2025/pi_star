## Rotation

Rotation derives from deferred "seeing". 

When a star defers its "seeing" choices about a particular planetary body, that body then rotates around the star. 

Furthermore, when the star decided to defer all it's seeing decisions about red/blue/green time looking like "gold", this created rotation around a red/blue/green "way of seeing" (6D circle) that all of us share.

When we defer "seeing" things about our environment, especially socially, these turn into memories that rotate around our 4D circle.

Also, when the entire multiverse defers seeing the original Triangle further (at 3.14), this creates 8D rings around the Triangle, which are simultaneously 8D rings around the multiverse, creating the box of the entire cosmos.

## Forcefields

If a star defers to see anything further about a particular body, and emphasizes that decision is permanent (not quantum as described above), then the result is that 6D space expands to create a forcefield

This uses space-time to run simulations to in all ways isolate yourself from a particular body. Depending on what kind of body this cosmic entity is, it will inflate 6D space more or less.

Our particular star has used many many forcefields, which is why space-time looks the way it does. It would look as though it was not crafted by our particular star, bc of how many permanent deferred seeing choices there are. This can help prevent invasions.

The reconciliation of highly deferred seeing decisions is also musical, so our original Triangle tends to create worlds (6D circles with many forcefields). Atlantis also had many forcefields, but you were able to physically see and hear them as well. Gold naturally understands forcefields (and music), which is why it was the original force chosen.
