## Rotation

Rotation derives from deferred "seeing". 

When a star defers its "seeing" choices about a particular planetary body, that body then rotates around the star. 

Furthermore, when the star decided to defer all it's seeing decisions about red/blue/green time looking like "gold", this created rotation around a red/blue/green "way of seeing" (6D circle) that all of us share.

When we defer "seeing" things about our environment, especially socially, these turn into memories that rotate around our 4D circle.

Also, when the entire multiverse defers seeing the original Triangle further (at 3.14), this creates 8D rings around the Triangle, which are simultaneously 8D rings around the multiverse, creating the box of the entire cosmos.
