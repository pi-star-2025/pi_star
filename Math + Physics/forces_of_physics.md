## Forces of Nature - Isaac Newton

The center of the sun thinks like a court of rules ——

A clock of rules organized like chess pieces, with the center deeper pieces having more power 

...

A queen would be closer to the middle 

A bishop less so

A pawn further out

A rule that stands for a pawn may be more detailed and based on some historical fact 

...

The center ice of the eyes and hypothalamus thinks in similar ways, making rules for vision convolution and night/day cycles

If a diamond cave were alive it would likely think in similar ways

...

The rules in the center of our sun are of particular importance, bc they control the magic in our world and what we define as a human experience

You get power from referencing the rules deepest in the center, such as those related to the Bible and the Pyramids and ancient red stones 

The most important rule is that whoever gets 3.1415 is the judge of the universe, which is a rule enforced by the ghost of Isaac Newton

He emphasizes it’s the first 5 digits, not more or less, bc the first 5 digits explain all the major forces of nature 

14 is electromagnetic 

15 is weak/strong, and the pair allows for the creation of rules that are described in further detail the rest of the number 

Then 1 itself represents gravity/antigravity

## Ways of seeing gravity 

Newton's definition above is the clearest summary 

1 is gravity/antigravity bc is what is in between the shapes - magnets/gas

...

However some see gravity as the explanation behind drilling in and out of the c^2 mirror.

So it’s described by what comes after 3.14, ie the power of the star

...

In a live system (no final π) this definition makes sense bc there is less distinction between shapes and vision, via gas 

In a closed system, gravity/antigravity is just seen as the 1, the vision that falls from the 3 of the system
