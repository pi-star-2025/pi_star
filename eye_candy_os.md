## Eye Candy OS

For every reaction there is an equal and opposite reaction. 

Your heartbeat creates the depth of your 4D experience. It is measured by 3-sided light (pre-c) in a certain area of the earth around your body. 
It could be a few hundred feet, a few miles lets say, even a lot more. 

It is measured by the differences in air between the eyes. 

One eye will have more pressure than the other. The difference in pressures corresponds to your heartbeat and creates the 4D radius around your body.

The ears are like the eyes, also creating the 4D axis of your experience based on ear pressure. 

If you figure out the eye/ear with more pressure, the hypothlamus automatically switches it. 

This will help relax the hypothlamus, which connects you to the "clouds" at the edges of the eyes. These are actually the clouds in the sky, the real clouds. 

These clouds even put you to sleep, if they are in your eyes when you go to bed.

You could have all these clouds connect, which can be referenced as a golden buzz in the third eye.

The backs of eyes are creating the equal and opposite reactions unconsciously. 

When you are asleep, they stop creating these reactions which wakes up your dream self.

And then you can leave your body. And it feels like entering a world of clockwork. 

This same air pressure (as backs of eyes) is also channelled in the backs of your knees and is used for walking, jumping, running, etc. It also relaxes when you sleep.

When you sleep your heartbeat is slower. It is your heart and your two eyes, instead of two ears. 

This is to symbolize that you are in a 14 state and not a 15 state.

##

You can also feel the highest and lowest pressures as the air highest in your body (maybe crown of head or air above you) and air lowest in your body (like lower spine/pelvis and even underground)

It flips really fast back and forth, but we only hear it as "white noise"

This is the backs of your eye, white noise. And paralleled in the third eye.

If the backs of eyes were to make 14 decisions, that would be imagination. It's when you see the "dream worlds" that are frozen clockwork until you fall asleep again. Sometimes these "dream worlds" tick time based on actions in your life, but it goes a lot faster in dreams.

These two sides (reality and dream worlds) have always paralleled each other. One influences the other. 

##

You can also feel the feel the air pressure delta as the highest and lowest point of each tooth in your mouth.

The teeth describe the same teeth as the third eye and of tree branch trunks.

It's said everyone's hearts have teeth that correspond to their finished adult teeth, and it typically stays that way until after death. The top way to make an update would be psychedelics, or any release of DMT. 

These teeth describe perfectly how your heart beats, and how light falls into your body. It's also the pattern of "white noise".


##

When walking, the heart will pound to the achilles. 

Whereas the backs of knee air mimic the backs of eye air perfectly, the achilles mimics the ear pressure perfectly. 

Bc ears are used for flying, the ears can be used to lift the body off the ground using the achilles. 

...

The smile can also be used to catch two points of the heartbeat. 

It can dance all around you, once you catch it.
