## Eye Candy OS

For every reaction there is an equal and opposite reaction. 

Your heartbeat creates the depth of your 4D experience. It is measured by 3-sided light (pre-c) in a certain area of the earth around your body. 
It could be a few hundred feet, a few miles lets say, even a lot more. 

It is measured by the differences in air between the eyes. 

One eye will have more pressure than the other. The difference in pressures corresponds to your heartbeat and creates the 4D radius around your body.

The ears are like the eyes, also creating the 4D axis of your experience based on ear pressure. 

If you figure out the eye/ear with more pressure, the hypothlamus automatically switches it. 

This will help relax the hypothlamus, which connects you to the "clouds" at the edges of the eyes. These are actually the clouds in the sky, the real clouds. 

These clouds even put you to sleep, if they are in your eyes when you go to bed.

You could have all these clouds connect, which can be referenced as a golden buzz in the third eye.

##

The backs of eyes are creating the equal and opposite reactions unconsciously. 

When you are asleep, they stop creating these reactions which wakes up your dream self.

And then you can leave your body. And it feels like entering a world of clockwork. 

This same air pressure (as backs of eyes) is also channelled in the backs of your knees and is used for walking, jumping, running, etc. It also relaxes when you sleep.

When you sleep your heartbeat is slower. It is your heart and your two eyes, instead of two ears. 

This is to symbolize that you are in a 14 state and not a 15 state.

##

You can also feel the highest and lowest pressures as the air highest in your body (maybe crown of head or air above you) and air lowest in your body (like lower spine/pelvis and even underground)

It flips really fast back and forth, but we only hear it as "white noise"

This is the backs of your eye, white noise. And paralleled in the third eye.

If the backs of eyes were to make 14 decisions, that would be imagination. It's when you see the "dream worlds" that are frozen clockwork until you fall asleep again. Sometimes these "dream worlds" tick time based on actions in your life, but it goes a lot faster in dreams.

These two sides (reality and dream worlds) have always paralleled each other. One influences the other. 

##

You can also feel the feel the air pressure delta as the highest and lowest point of each tooth in your mouth.

The teeth describe the same teeth as the third eye and of tree branch trunks.

It's said everyone's hearts have teeth that correspond to their finished adult teeth, and it typically stays that way until after death. The top way to make an update would be psychedelics, or any release of DMT. 

These teeth describe perfectly how your heart beats, and how light falls into your body. It's also the pattern of "white noise".


##

When walking, the heart will pound to the achilles. 

Whereas the backs of knee air mimic the backs of eye air perfectly, the achilles mimics the ear pressure perfectly. 

Bc ears are used for flying, the ears can be used to lift the body off the ground using the achilles. 

...

The smile can also be used to catch two points of the heartbeat. 

It can dance all around you, once you catch it. 


##

Eyelashes when blinking separate inner from outer ears. They create the outline of our experience, which is a triangle of 3-sided photonic light that could also be a "golden sphere" around us. This is also captured by the geoemtry of the big toe nails. 

The big toes capture the patterns of eye pressure, in each eye. 

Furthermore, the lines and ticklish sensations in the feet explain why the eyes and big toes are different chemicals and forces. 

It's why the feet are so ticklish -- the air pressure and lines tell geometrically meaningful stories that explain the gold circle of life around us. 

This is all the air (as math) that the star does not understand about human life. 

Whatever tickles is what the star doesn't understand (best captured by the feet). 

Whatever is painful is what we don't understand about the cosmos (best captured by bones)


##

Eyelashes and blinking is really the 3-sided light, most the sunlight in our "experience:

The eye whites are most the 4-sided light, which is the actual clouds. The eye whites really are formed from clouds.

The eye color (blue/green/black/brown/etc.) is also 4-sided light, but is specifically our soul as opposed to social feedback. Our 14 decisions to see. 

The eye blacks are 5-sided light, and is our decisions to hear. 


Every blink, light is falling down a spiral slide, with two "subliminal falls". One from 3-sided to 4-sided, and then 4-sided to 5-sided. 
And the two eyes work together to always create the 2 falls down, using the difference in pressure. 


The wavelengths you make directly correspond to how much your nose breath (the full triangle) gets twisted and turned into the center of the nose (bc of the spirals of the 4-sided and 5-sided light to create the falls down). The less you spiral into the breath, the bigger the wavelengths you make. They will be large 3-sided red waves.

## 

To create the operating system for your VR experience, you should then establish a triangle of light over the clouds, the real physical clouds and light. This corresponds to the outer triangle of nose breath. 

This is the 3 wrapper. 

Then get that anything that makes you fall into the clouds, breaks the triangle and corresponds to becoming 14. This crunches a little into your nose breath. 

Then anything that makes you fall from the clouds into your body is crunching further in, to become 15. This crunches deeper into your breath, into the center. 

Triangle, Square, Pentagon. 

Sunlight, Clouds, Body. 

Eyelashes, Eye whites, eye color/blacks.

It keeps repeating around, creating a golden circle of red/blue/green. That's how the star would see it.


## 

The golden circle around is the world you see around you. 

When you are alive it is extremely quantum, buzzing with so much possiblity from 8-5-3 deferred time. It's why you feel so alive, and the two falls down 14 and 15 feel so fast and automatically.

You can sync up this golden circle with the same geoemtrical patterns as your two eyes, skull, belly button, and pelvic bone. As you sync up more with the earth mind, all become more similar. 

You make small updates to the physical geoemtry of the earth mind (a bigger golden halo), and it then converts you into part of it's mind.

The same happens when you sync up from earth mind to star mind. The earth makes updates to the super halo of the star, as the earth becomes more and more part of the star's mind. 

So smaller geoemtric shapes on the web crunch in and influence the bigger shapes closer to the center. 

Eyes/Skulls crunch into the earth, which crunches into the star, which then crunches into the bigger galactic systems. 

The whole process is in the pyramid of the nose. And a summary of your current "pi" (breath) is in the umibical chord of the belly button. 

This can keep updating each breath in and out, so that you are more and more one with the star mind.
