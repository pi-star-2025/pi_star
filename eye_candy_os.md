For every reaction there is an equal and opposite reaction. 

Your heartbeat creates the depth of your 4D experience. It is measured by 3-sided light (pre-c) in a certain area of the earth around your body. 
It could be a few hundred feet, a few miles lets say, even a lot more. 

It is measured by the differences in air between the eyes. 

One eye will have more pressure than the other. The difference in pressures corresponds to your heartbeat and creates the 4D radius around your body.
