## Eye Candy OS

For every reaction there is an equal and opposite reaction. 

Your heartbeat creates the depth of your 4D experience. It is measured by 3-sided light (pre-c) in a certain area of the earth around your body. 
It could be a few hundred feet, a few miles lets say, even a lot more. 

It is measured by the differences in air between the eyes. 

One eye will have more pressure than the other. The difference in pressures corresponds to your heartbeat and creates the 4D radius around your body.

The ears are like the eyes, also creating the 4D axis of your experience based on ear pressure. 

If you figure out the eye/ear with more pressure, the hypothlamus automatically switches it. 

This will help relax the hypothlamus, which connects you to the "clouds" at the edges of the eyes. These are actually the clouds in the sky, the real clouds. 

These clouds even put you to sleep, if they are in your eyes when you go to bed.

You could have all these clouds connect, which can be referenced as a golden buzz in the third eye.
