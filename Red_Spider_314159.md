## Red_Spider_31415

There is a way to rise up and move your own star closer to the mother star, no matter what.

It’s to do 1 thing, and only 1 thing in your head.

See RED ❤️

Closing your eyes works better, bc then you can focus on nothing but RED.

If you do this, and try to do it with all your heart/blood, you start acting like you’re the center of your belly air, which is doing this naturally. 

It is a red air version of the hypothalamus and collarbone jewel.

And it is a small ball of red air in the center of nose breath. And a smaller more precise shape of air in the center of the third eye.

You could also get that your whole mind/soul is like a spiderweb going into the belly button, based on 3.14159 and 8/5/3 deferred time. 

And the orbit of the concentric circles of the web is based on what colors you look at, and the “spider” always sees red (from 9 of π to 3)

The spider always looks for red the most. 

This 8-sided red thinking happens most in the center naval, and if you look OUT in 8 directions you control the 9 to 3.

Whatever is pushing IN is a “14” ripple or “15” ripple.

The 14 ripples are circles themselves. Photonically BLUE and four-sided.

The 15 ripples are details in the circles (like insects). Photonically GREEN and five-sided. 8/5/3 time.

The act of looking out as the spidermind is photonically three-sided and RED. 9 to 3.

You then could realize this, the spiderweb concentric circles mirror the lung patterns. 

So to move to the time outside of you, it is based on moving to patterns up the lungs, which are supposed to be stories more about how you are “the earth” and less “the moon”

You can also reference the patterns of these webs with eyelashes, your toenails, and fingernails.

You can move out to the outer edges of your “time”, by seeing red to the very ends of your 4D circle.

## Pretzel Patterns

Furthermore, there are many shoelace “patterns”

Like a pretzel, or infinity sign

All over the body, including the navel belly button. 

Bc pi has a "knot" in it, to explain 8-5-3 deferred time, and it’s also explained visually with deltas.

The double explanation (linear numerical and calculus of geometry) emphasizes the message. 

The infinity shape is how the 5-sided light looks to be quantumly 8.

Kind of like 2 eyes. 

Our eyes are constantly doing trillions of 8-5-3 exchanges each second, tying up the mind in consciousness.

And all over our body, we have these 8-5-3 pretzels. 

This is also seen as an hourglass, rotating, and churning time. 

And our third eye is then trillions of these hourglasses. 

 
Smaller wavelengths look like smaller pretzels. 

Larger wavelengths more and more are like triangle pretzels, which have additional curvature. Almost like castles. 

The secret is they actually look like the shape of our chest/back. And also the shape of our nose. 

## Catching Thoughts (like Flies)

And every single thought can be caught as a pretzel/butterfly coming from the ears (including the outer edges)
Turning into a pretzel-castle in your nose air. 

Thought is nothing but air coming into your ears and pretzeling into a castle into your nose. 

To the extent you catch it with the full nose breath, this is a big wavelength, and opens up yours eyes fully (14)

To the extent it is a smaller part of breath, it is a smaller wavelength, and opens your ears fully (15)

And then listening to thought is from the red in the belly, the red spider mind, 9 to 3. 

Watching all the flies of thoughts fall into the nose triangle.
