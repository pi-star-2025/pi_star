## Sun

3.14159 is most like a point. 

3.14 is the c^2 mirror

3.1415 is protruding with c^3.

And then 3.14159 captures this protrusion with a point.

3.141592 captures it with a line, or an array going in the direction of c^3

...

In a sun, the 9 represents the dead center. The 2 is then not just an array, but a circle of arrays (spokes of sunlight)

In an atom, the 5 represents the outer electrons, 9 represents the very center of the atom, and 2 represents its circular vision. 

Thus, the definition of a sun is when the 2 in 3.141592 is a circle of arrays, not only one array. This means that the physical sun itself is a stable 3.14159 system.
