## π Simplified 🥧

3.1415

Is the number which best helps us measure the area of a circle 

It also best describes how a circle curves, the math behind it 

If studied the numbers stand for a 5-sided shape exactly inside of a 4-sided shape exactly inside of a 3-sided shape 

The .1 is the best numerical representation of “seeing” or “nesting” 

This is bc “seeing” always means to see something in more detail, and .1 is an exact “perpendicular” way to create a smaller version with 1 number.

1 is a straight fall from the 3 sided shape

In contrast, the number 0 would be no movement like 3.0 

And .9 represents falling/nesting, but as little as possible, so .99999999 is inside the 3 but with as little of a fall as possible 

So it’s 3.1415 to represent a triangle sees a square which sees a pentagon, bc 1 creates perpendicular nesting
