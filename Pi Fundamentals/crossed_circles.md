## Crossed Circles

As you go further and further down π, the number describes how to focus better and better, creating the length of time and the blackhole.

Mathematically, π will reference wider and wider "circular" shapes. First a triangle, then square, then pentagon, then magnetic field, then galaxy, etc.

The next "circle" will always reference all previous circles by the criss-crossing of the numbers. In particular, it will represent the different sides of each of the previous circles (the quantum possibilities they have created).

Hence the next circle will represent the diagonals (possibilities) of the previous circles, and by doing so, you render the time of next "circular" level.

So we know 35897932384626 criss-crosses to represent the possibilities of the magnetic field 3.14159265.
