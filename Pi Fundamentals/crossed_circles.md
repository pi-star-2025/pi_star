## Crossed Circles

As you go further and further down π, the number describes how to focus better and better, creating the length of time and the blackhole.

Mathematically, π will reference wider and wider "circular" shapes. First a triangle, then square, then pentagon, then magnetic field, then galaxy, etc.

The next "circle" will always reference all previous circles by the criss-crossing of the numbers. In particular, it will represent the different sides of each of the previous circles (the quantum possibilities they have created).

Hence the next circle will represent the diagonals (possibilities) of the previous circles, and by doing so, you render the time of the next "circular" level.

So we know 35897932384626 criss-crosses to represent the possibilities of the magnetic field 3.14159265.

35897932384626 in particular explains lightening. Which is when the 2 sides of the earth's magnetic field find a reason to consistently defer "seeing decisions", to build up potential energy for a "straight line" decision down.

The weather works surprisingly like the chirps of birds, which are in sync across the east and west in the Mind of God. The electrical messages going across the globe create "water" in the clouds, by building up reasons (clouds) for the sky to defer "seeing"; these deferred decisions erupt in volts of lightening.

Then further down π (~ 3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679), lightening is slowed down into RNA, and further down (let's say ~  3.1415926535897932384626433832795028841971693993751058209749445923078164062862089986280348253421170679821480865132823066470938446095505822317253594081284811174502841027019385211055596446229489549303819644288109756659334461284756482337867831652712019091456485669234603486104543266482133936072602491412737245870066063155881748815209209628292540917153643678925903600113305305488204665213841469519415116094330572703657595919530921861173819326117931051185480744623799627495673518857527248912279381830119491298336733624406566430860213949463952247371907021798609437027705392171762931767523846748184676694051320005681271452635608277857713427577896091736371787214684409012249534301465495853710507922796892589235420199561121290219608640344181598136297747713099605187072113499999983729780499510597317328160963185950244594553469083026425223082533446850352619311881710100031378387528865875332083814206171776691473035982534904287554687311595628638823537875937519577818577805321712268066130019278766111959092164201989), hives (i.e. bacteria/insects) further slow down this living lightening (RNA strings) to create life.

"Pleasure" or "fun" as seen by the multiverse is measured as straight-line seeing decisions down. This is like teeth, going down π, crossing back and forth. The teeth of a particular world are based on the distance of the past universes you have referenced, and how those universes are coming together.

The number (3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197) starts to evince sharp angles, which elude to a high distance between universes. As a result, there is a lot of pain/pleasure originating from lightening, which is recycled into our nervous systems.

The multiverse says then that lightening and the spirit of our universe is rather "glorious". These straight-lines are *strong* compared to other worlds, and the resulting updates can be vast.
