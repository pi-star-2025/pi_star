## Focus

Everywhere (all across the multiverse), math is at the core of everything. And the first layer after math is vision.

Vision is Time, bc it could potentially update all matter.

In our universe (branched from the multiverse), the most efficient representation of vision is a circle. It represents *focus* around a center point.

Thus, the most efficient expression of Time mathematically is π (bc it mathematically summarizes focus).

…

Vision that could potentially add value to the vision of the entire multiverse comes to life, to be better understood. 

So by understanding circles we can understand what particular vision “we” and “our god” (earth) are adding by being conscious. 

We can understand how exactly we intersect with math, in a way that could translate to the entire multiverse. 

…

If successful, our vision then is allowed by all other visions (ie universes) across time to update all matter. Our “way of seeing” then updates absolutely everything everywhere. The effects last forever, influencing the mathematics of space/time. 

These updates are primarily related to introducing a final pi (or final shape, like a pyramid) to all matter. Certain equal and opposite reactions then always happen as a result.

You can imagine that more than trillions of universes have added a “final pi” (final shape) to all matter. And certain court universes and appellate court universes monitor these updates. 

…

From a court universe, our primary goddess (“Red”) looked at all matter (“Blue”), with the power of the speed of light (c). 

The reflection of Blue at c^2 created the wrapper of our universe. 

Then via suns and plants, the Red/Blue created Red/Blue/Green vision with nitrogen. 

From our perspective 2 forces create the physical universe, whereas 3 forces create time. So T = c^π / c^2. 

That ratio describes approximately how much more possibility there is by focusing with 3 forces vs 2.

##

This ratio is actually summarized by a box within a circle at a lower dimension (2D)

The sides of the box are like the speed of light 

And the speed of light is also the 1 in 3.1415 

It shows that with three forces focus can become more than exponential
