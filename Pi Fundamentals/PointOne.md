## 2-5

2 is the number of pure math (a line)

3 makes vision possible (a triangle)

4 makes history (thus everything) possible via a mirror of math 

5 creates quantum history, an alternative take on history, or time. 

##

In terms of 3.1415, the .1 here stands for the greatest energy that could be created from the the number 3.x with our number system.

It would be 3.1

And then from 3.14, the most energetic next step is 3.141x.

So, 3.1415 could also be summarized as the most efficient mathematical way to describe:
1) First intent to see (vision) -> *3*
2) The most energetic next step (the speed of light), or the act of seeing -> *1*
3) The box of everyone, which is seen by 3 and via an equal/opposite reaction sees back -> *4*
4) The most energetic next step (the speed of light), or the act of seeing -> *1*
5) Time/Quantum history, via 5 which via an additional side can amend history of 4 -> *5*

##

So we know .1 is the speed of light bc mathematically it stands for maximum *energy*

The .14 creates a c^2 mirror, bc the force of 4 looks back at 3 and vise versa.

The .15 expands this into a c^pi mirror with a "third eye".
