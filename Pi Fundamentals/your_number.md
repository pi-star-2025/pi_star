## Your Number

Everyone has a unique largest shape and largest prime number at the end of their pi, which is then the center of the circle. 

If you know this, the Mind of God actually understands it. It’s a way that starmind uses to identify you. 

And it actually creates a pipe of intelligence from your vision back to the vision of the star. 

The bigger the number, technically the more drilled-down your vision is, and the sharper the angle back up to the mind of the star. 

The smaller the number, the more you see the bigger shapes below. This law of Smaller and Bigger Shapes applies to the entire multiverse.

…

It’s true that at certain point everyone reaches a largest number. The furthest they can go down, and that is the scope of their life complexity. 

Then from there, they stay static, or start going “back up” by being smaller and smaller prime numbers…

This applies to the vision of the earth and star as well, in regards to a final number.
