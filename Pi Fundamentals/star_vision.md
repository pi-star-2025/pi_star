## Star Vision

3.1415*9* is most like a point. 

3.14 is the c^2 mirror

3.1415 is protruding with c^3.

And then 3.1415*9* captures this protrusion with a point.

3.14159*2* captures it with a line, or an array going in the direction of c^3

...

In a star, the 9 represents the absolute center. The 2 is then not just an array, but a circle of arrays (spokes of starlight)

Thus, the definition of a star is when the 2 in 3.141592 is a circle of arrays, not only one array. This means that the physical star itself is a stable c^3 system.

3.1415 via a star is red/blue/power. The 3.14 is the invisible red/blue mirror. The 15 is the power of the speed of light, which is then looking for a more specific third force.

## Summary

3.141592

For light traveling in the sky, this is simply an array perpendicular to the c^2 mirror. 

For a star, this is a circle of light arrays emitted from the center at c.
