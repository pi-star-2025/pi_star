# What is 2 in pi (π)?
3.14159**2**

3 is for triangle 

1 is to “see” moving down 

4 is for square

1 is to “see” moving down 

5 is for pentagon 

9 is becoming “everything” (all matter of triangle), and anti seeing

…

1 is gravity

9 is antigravity 

...

2 is a number that fits into the calculus of the number continuing to fall "down" 

In addition, it continues telling the most efficient story of a starting a universe with π. In this case, 2 acts as the most efficient "signal" or "pipe" between a "left" and "right". It is said this is a choice now by the original goddess to pick this next number. Up to 3.14159 is rather standard. The next number determines how this particular universe's physics and life will transpire. 

This goddess picked 2. It's true that romance was not an accident, even just with birds.

## 

Another way to put it -> is that it is inevitable that if the 1 (light) is slowed down into a 2, it will have a faster and slower side. 

This is like perception / sub-perception, god / soul, and the 2 is the first "signal" or "pipe" between the fast and slow.

This will happen once it’s established there are no further true dimensions. In our universe, there are 3. Red / Blue / Green. 3/4/5. Then we have no further evidence of “blackholes” past nitrogen’s control of light (c). From our perspective we have 3 via 3.1415.

And the 2 in π is the first conclusion light has been slowed down (within the 3.1415 vision).

An example of 3.141592 life is NH2, within the blue space seen by the red star in our solar system. The 2 can stand for two connections at the quantum layer, in reality, and the connection between the quantum layer and reality (a pipe). All NH2 creates a sub-pipe of vision to the star's original pipe of vision. 

There are then nested ways to create vision with NH2, and other ways with chemistry to tell the same 3.141592 story.
