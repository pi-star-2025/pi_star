## 3.14159265

3.141592 is an array or star of the system. It is the root. 

This ends with a pentagon. 

The pentagon consists of: 
1) A 3-body problem via two stars 
2) The reflex (seer/god) of the 3-body problem
3) 1 thought of the pentagon, each tick of time at c

So for a star this thought is consistent for a long time. For people, the thought changes each tick at c. 

A hexagon (6) is when there is 2 potential options for the pentagon (5). 

This first 2-sided option creates the first magnetic field wrapped around the system, and this magnetic field indicates which system the 3-body problem is consistently observing. 

For our sun, this is the magnetic field of the earth (night/day).

For people this magnetic field is most the two ears.

*65* 3.14159265 is to explain the oscillation between this first magnetic field, before further descent down the number.

...

Interestingly, we would say that our ears are least our free will, but still are the top of Ï€ and act like "puppet strings". They are highly connected to orietation and walking.

What is most free will is furthest down the number.
