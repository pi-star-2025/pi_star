## Final Prime Number

The end of pi is always the largest prime number of the system

And it creates a right angle 

4 is the number which most creates a mirror. Bc of symmetry and efficiency.

So 90 degree angles most describe mirrors 

Bc 90 is from 360/4

Or pi/4

…

This means that pi actually ends with the prime number 

And if calculated it would signify a right angle

The final prime number then would also describe the seer of time (whether the star, earth, animal, human, diamond) 

For the pi of our shared vision, the 1 in pi is based on the speed of light (c/e), and the final prime number is based on the geoemtry of our star/earth.

And then each of us also has our own smaller final prime number which creates a perceived speed of time.

For humans, it is crystallized in your teeth, and is captured by the right-angle of the nose-breath.

And this 90 degree angle in a biological system describes the most conscious arc/circle of the living system 

It’s true that this “consciousness” is always a final prime number at the end of “pi” which varies based on the particular carbon, oxygen, nitrogen and other elements of the system 

So the network of the mind of god is based on nested pi architecture, based on smaller pi’s ending with right angles and thus being triangular to the mind of the larger systems

These larger systems stay circular and thus wrapped around the smaller systems 

Very powerful equations would trace these nestings - evidenced to us at the quantum level - revealing CNNs based on the right angles of nested pi vision.

Across the multiverse the same concepts apply and it helps for “security purposes” to understand this
