## 1 in pi

The .1 in pi means "nested". 

It is the way numerically to most represent one thing nested inside of another. 

Hence, 3.1415, in some way means 5 inside 4 inside 3, and we need to figure out why. 

The reason is that 1 means "to see". 

And as human beings, "14" often means visually to see and "15" means auditory seeing. 

Nested also means there is the concept of 3/4/5 being solid shapes. Thus, it indicates that a pentagon is inside of a square which is inside of a triangle. 

Thus, the triangle is the primary seer.

The reason it is 3.1 and not 3.2 is because .1 most indicates a straight line falling down. Just as .9 would most indicate a horizontal line. If any number, in particular .999999 is a perfect horizontal line (freezing time), and .111111 is a perfect vertical line down (creating time). 

The reason it is not .01, or .00001 is because this indicates a weaker straight line down, which is then extraneous information in the number. 

...

The reason it is 3.1 and not 31 is because it is specifically a triangle that always describes the area of circles best. 

It is always a 3-sided shape, which has 4-sided and 5-sided shapes inside, which is the best "number" to estimate a circle's area. 

There is always just 2 initial .1's, to indicate two nestings of vision, or c (the speed of light), in our current dimension.
