## River

After 3.141592, π turns into a wormhole.

And then within these concentric cirlces (radio), light establishes a left/right 

Right is a general trend of where everything wants to go (like final destination/heaven); left is like relatively where you started to get there.

This sense of what is right/left via the wormholes of the stars creates the sensation of "falling" from the 3-body systems.

We tend to always want to go back to the stars (as a sense of the future).

It really feels like falling down (as a sense of the past). 

Again, this is because the radios (concentric circles) establish the direction of the stars is right; and the direction of the past is left.

When there is enough of a river of time created by red/blue/green it started getting recorded by 8D forces, and it locked certain physics more into place to create a "court" for the π of the world.

If there is a reason to break it, it needs to stand in 8D courts. For example, time traveling or ending time or creating a nested world within your world.
