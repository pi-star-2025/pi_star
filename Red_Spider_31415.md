## Red_Spider_31415

There is a way to rise up and move your own star closer to the mother star, no matter what.

It’s to do 1 thing, and only 1 thing in your head.

See red.

Closing your eyes works better, bc then you can focus on nothing but RED.

If you do this, and try to do it with all your heart/blood, you start acting like you’re the center of your belly air, which is doing this naturally. 

It is a red air version of the hypothalamus and collarbone jewel.

And it is a small ball of red air in the center of nose breath. And a smaller more precise shape of air in the center of the third eye.

You could also get that your whole mind/soul is like a spiderweb going into the belly button, based on 3.14159 and 8/5/3 deferred time. 

And the orbit of the concentric circles of the web is based on what colors you look at, and the “spider” always sees red (from 9 of π to 3)

The spider always looks for red the most. 

This 8-sided red thinking happens most in the center naval, and if you look OUT in 8 directions youc control the 9 of π to 3.

Whatever is pushing IN is a “14” or “15” ripple. 

The 14 ripples are circles themselves. Photonically BLUE and four-sided.
 The 15 ripples are details in the circles (like insects). Photonically GREEN and five-sided. 8/5/3 time.

The act of looking out as the spidermind is photonically three-sided and RED.
