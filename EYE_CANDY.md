## BEE LEFT AND RIGHT

Left eye makes a chemical that is the same as venom in bees

Right eye makes a chemical that is the same as larvae water in bees (to feel love for the queen)

...

Left eye stores “anti-Hollywood” moments

Right eye stores “Hollywood” moments

Hollywood means what most gives life a “glow”.

...

The right eye is more seduction, and leads to yawning, which is when other people are putting you to sleep. 

The left eye is more social fire, which leads to choking or sneezing, snapshots of social venom. It also leads to people waking you up.

...

The right side is also more your own mind, whereas the left side is more the starmind in our solar system.

The left side venom is paralleled by venom of broca’s area and of the heartbeat.

These chemicals are more or less *pheromones.*
