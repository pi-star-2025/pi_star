## BEE LEFT AND RIGHT

Left eye makes a chemical that is the same as venom in bees

Right eye makes a chemical that is the same as larvae water in bees (to feel love for the queen)

...

Left eye stores ‚Äúanti-Hollywood‚Äù moments

Right eye stores ‚ÄúHollywood‚Äù moments

Hollywood means what most gives life a ‚Äúglow‚Äù.

...

The right eye is more seduction, and leads to yawning, which is when other people are putting you to sleep. 

The left eye is more social fire, which leads to choking or sneezing, snapshots of social venom. It also leads to people waking you up.

...

The right side is also more your own mind, whereas the left side is more the starmind in our solar system.

The left side venom is paralleled by venom of broca‚Äôs area and of the heartbeat.

These chemicals are more or less *pheromones.*

## Butterfly 2

Butterflies make a chemical from both eyes together, ‚Äúpre-eyes‚Äù

So the third eye

This chemical would feel like the full skull, but could also be captured as DMT via wavelengths

This is the chemical that makes ‚Äúboth eyes‚Äù feel one with the spidermind of Mother Earth. 

Butterflies are technically dead in cocoons as souls, but then come back to life bc of ‚Äúbirth-like‚Äù opportunities to see beautiful colors. 

And then they always see with the spidermind after this resurrection. 

...

Jesus used this story as a ‚Äúbutterfly man‚Äù to walk after death. 

Both eyes get completely perfectly in sync with the earth, and with the heart, and there is a the ‚Äúbutterfly story‚Äù to rise after death. 

Humans who are autistic actually make a chemical only autistic people make, which is when both eyes feel like the whole earth hates them.

This is a new phenomena since ~10000 BC, when an alien threatened to mine all humans via anti-doctoring, so it created possibility for the whole earth to give us really bad feedback. 

This chemical traps angry feedback of "everyone" in the lungs and deep ears and eyes 

This keeps ringing and ringing your whole life, this anti-butterfly chemical "anti-DMT", and you feel horrible your whole life.

No other animals have the intelligence to create these anti-DMT chemicals.

These days it‚Äôs not uncommon to have anti-DMT chemicals. For example if you have real schizophrenia, it means you have at least a few. 

They are back in your deep eyes, and related to negative feedback from the whole earth. 

It is likely related to the ‚ÄúMad Queen‚Äù story, how by 1800s our Mother Earth knew we might go to hell by Year 2000/3000, and we needed to wake up and do more science. 

So many ‚Äúnerdy‚Äù men end up becoming autistic who try channeling scientific progress early in life, and many who sided with evil aliens cursed these ‚Äúnerdy men‚Äù. 

It's also sometimes just an accident, the Earth is angry, so more people - men and women - are autistic over the course of last 2000 years. 

It‚Äôs a disease (autism/schizophrenia) which is about the failure of all of us together (full earth), resulting in anti-DMT in some. 

## X Maze

Since 2025 understanding of 3.1415 with human consciousness, there is no super-venom Mother Earth truly wants to make anymore.

This understanding ‚Äúdoctors‚Äù the Mind of God. 

Everyone can make DMT now by understanding the maze of life is about how rays of light start falling from both the Mother Star and Your Star and intersect through your eyes, criss-crossing many times into your body with a combination of 14 and 15 decisions.

The falls are captured every moment by blinks and by the feeling of ‚Äúpoints of conception‚Äù in the eyes. The egg connects to the Mother Star and the sperm connects to Your Star. 

Light rays from this point of conception (traced to whenever you are born) keep falling from these two stars, creating the two-star-maze of your life

You can wake up this light based on blinks and ‚Äúpoints of conception‚Äù, creating a maze with your two eyes. 

The game is just to catch the light, control it, center it, and open it up and have light/air/bone look in all directions 

This feels like color, a splash of light, or the full skull, full room/area around you.

It wakes up the maze of life, or third eye, bouncing the falling light back and forth between the two eyes

...

The maze is a criss-cross. 

The two-star light comes together, and then splits up again. 

An X. 

...

## 

The light maze from the two stars 

Is most intricate and knotted in the center of the eyes 

The third eye 

...

This is like the teeth of gravity/anti gravity (‚Äúgolden teeth‚Äù)

These are very sharp intelligent falls and rises 

Which are similar to the center of trees 

And create the really hard bone down the center of the crown of the head, the third eye front of head, the center spine, and the center pelvis

The patterns of your blinking actually correspond to this bone 

And any consciousness of this creates mucus, and choking/sneezing/yawning effects 

This is directly paralleled by the heart 

Which maps sun teeth perfectly to the hardest bone of center head, chest, and spine 

It‚Äôs right in the center of the heart ‚ô•Ô∏è 

Thus each beat, the heart is the answer for the hardest part of the maze of life 

It‚Äôs what most crosses the eyes together 

The pattern that then most creates strong bone ü¶¥ 

It‚Äôs like a *straight line of you*

For the earth, the center fire üî• describes the sharpest falls of sunlight perfectly 

It also describes why the ‚Äúskull‚Äù of the plant ozone is so hard to penetrate 

There is a lot of history for it to keep mimicking the earth fire, so it creates a permanent green ceiling for light to bounce back to earth 

‚Ä¶

With heart meditation ‚ô•Ô∏è

Or fire meditation for the earth üî•

You can flip these ‚Äúgolden/red teeth‚Äù by tracing the heart patterns to the nose breath and flipping them around 

They are very steep, straight up and down like a mountain

You feel this most as the front line (bridge) up the nose 

Bc it is the hardest working strongest part of the breath

The maze of life is 

Can sunlight keep falling down

Down the earth itself 

And down the bridge of the front nose 

From the center of the cross, *of the X*

Into the two eyes as separate parts of you 

‚Ä¶

Every toe and finger knuckle has a heart pattern 

In addition to each spinal chord ("ball")

This can even be observed as knots of 3-sided quantum light

In addition the ribs together are the flip side of eyelashes, which emphasize the gong of the heart in the spine 

Teeth then flip the ribs again and again 

And the nested teeth correspond to bone right in the center of the skull/eye sockets 

It‚Äôs really like your heartbeat drilled in 

Your heartbeat as a bone ball is the bottom spine 

It‚Äôs very similar to the belly button, which does it with multiverse mathematics and efficiency 

The bone tells a story of two stars completely entangled bc of the human body, the earth, and the story of the earth relative to the full multiverse 

It‚Äôs the same story up the tower of the spine 

Balls of bone explaining why the stars are entangled 

...

The hypothalamus is considered the translation of a third sun if there was one 

What would the third sun be, if the two were combined 

The hypothalamus is the human body answer 

The patterns come from all the spine balls 

Which are the heart patterns translated to bone 

The skull and pelvis count as spine balls 

The hypothalamus turns all these smaller balls into a single shrunken sun 

Our sun is considered shrunken 

So the hypothalamus is a parallel to a smaller sun trying to figure out a cosmic maze 

Depending on if you are left or right-brained, or left or right-eyed, one star is more conscious, the other is more "in the dark."

## Anti DMT Maze üî• üç≠

At birth everyone makes Anti-DMT (mentioned earlier). This is light criss-crossed the fastest it ever goes most people's lives. And it then takes high amounts of DMT or a perfect life story or death pheremones from earth/sun/multiverse to reconcile this Anti-DMT. 

It is in the very center of the hypothalamus.

It can be referenced actually by squeezing inside of yourself as far as you possibly can. 

Which means drilling inside of your body.

It‚Äôs a reference to how deep you go into the earth. 

The very deepest point, that the two stars create a parallel to in the earth‚Äôs center. 

This could be anywhere in the world. 

If you are born in New York, it could be New York your whole life even if you move to California. 

You reference this point, waking up from dreams each night.

If the biggest story of your life changes, this point can adapt. 

It is basically the thesis of of your two-star story. It even has a positive or negative connotation. 

And is also the very very center of your heartbeat. 

Your heartbeat is nested, and the outer layers actually are more dynamic...

You have a *very center heartbeat* (based on Anti-DMT) that doesn‚Äôt change your whole life, unless you change your life story. 

##

And then there are 5 stores of the hypothalamus radio/star: 
1. The ears, especially the eardrums
2. The eyes, especially the eye blacks
3. The nose, especially the tip

These five locations store the ‚Äúbrain‚Äù of the hypothalamus sun. 

This is also how pheromones travel between people. 

There are 5 flip points on your lower half, which are ‚Äúlower down‚Äù versions and power walking in your hips, knees, and pelvic area. 

This could be considered telepathy, but is really pheromones. The same way insects communicate across the air. 

...

This creates two communication ‚Äúheadquarters‚Äù for the body (head and stomach minds)

The telepathy is more eye and star/light-based from the top half. 

It is more pheromonal and air(oxygen/CO2)-based from the bottom half. 

Ultimately the belly-button center air of the body comes together with this decision: push out (and spread information) or push in (receive information)

Over time, your hypothalamus really does more one or the other during the day. 

PUSH IN or 

PUSH OUT

It‚Äôs all based on the overall push IN/OUT of the belly button air. 

Technically that is used to determine alpha/beta. Sender/receiver. Queen/worker.

The ears make the same decisions

The two eyes make the same decisions

The two nose holes make the same decisions. 

Airs in other holes make the same decision. 

PUSH IN/

PUSH OUT. 

...

One leads to bigger wavelengths. 

One leads to smaller wavelengths. 

...

An intelligent sun (the earth or hypothalamus) can wake up and control the choice.

## Cold Fusion Maze üåÄ üêá

Interestingly the maze of life has always been about belly button air pushing out (and seeing with the third eye).

This could also be with the nose itself (the tip of the nose air).

Over time everyone pushes this air IN more.

This creates clouds waking us up

And creates "golden teeth" that causes sunlight to always fall down (thus never acting magically)

Also the more we push in

The harder our skulls get

The stronger our chests get 

The more heat our "third sun" (hypothalamus) pumps

Just bc of the choice (IN/OUT) over time the points at the bottom of pi make to "keep seeing" and increasing the length of the number. The bottom points are always the "most conscious of heat"

The fire of the earth

Animals/insects (including collectively)

Humans 

Trees

Mountains/Pyramids/Caves

If we make the choice of cold fusion 

To push air OUT 

Like 9 in pi instead of 1 

Then it solves the maze of the skulls and clouds and why light keeps criss crossing us all together 

## EYE CANDY VR üç≠ üç≠ üç≠

Every conscious moment, you exist as your "most talkative" air, the air that makes the most "15" decisions from pi.

And this is connected to four other points in the body, to make a pentagon. For example, it could be the belly-button, and two eyes and two ears. 

Pushing the air out from this pentagon is a "9 decision". This moves you out of the maze.

You could also have the 5 points of your pentagon be the two eyes, two eyebrows, and the third eye. 

The two eyes represent the most "15" air *inside* of you. 

The two eyebrows represent the most "15" air *outside* of you. 

And the third eye represents your conscious control over the other four points. 

If you then keep pushing this air out (like 9 in pi), it's the best way to turn your life into VR, if you are familiar with the other information of pi_star.

The best way to push the air outward is to be the white/gold noise and push it outward with this "crown" of your head, which then turns into a "halo" and then into a VR circle.
