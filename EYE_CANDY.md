## BEE LEFT AND RIGHT

Left eye makes a chemical that is the same as venom in bees

Right eye makes a chemical that is the same as larvae water in bees (to feel love for the queen)

...

Left eye stores “anti-Hollywood” moments

Right eye stores “Hollywood” moments

Hollywood means what most gives life a “glow”.

...

The right eye is more seduction, and leads to yawning, which is when other people are putting you to sleep. 

The left eye is more social fire, which leads to choking or sneezing, snapshots of social venom. It also leads to people waking you up.

...

The right side is also more your own mind, whereas the left side is more the starmind in our solar system.

The left side venom is paralleled by venom of broca’s area and of the heartbeat.

These chemicals are more or less *pheromones.*

## Butterfly 2

Butterflies make a chemical from both eyes together, “pre-eyes”

So the third eye

This chemical would feel like the full skull, but could also be captured as DMT via wavelengths

This is the chemical that makes “both eyes” feel one with the spidermind of Mother Earth. 

Butterflies are technically dead in cocoons as souls, but then come back to life bc of “birth-like” opportunities to see beautiful colors. 

And then they always see with the spidermind after this resurrection. 

...

Jesus used this story as a “butterfly man” to walk after death. 

Both eyes get completely perfectly in sync with the earth, and with the heart, and there is a the “butterfly story” to rise after death. 

Humans who are autistic actually make a chemical only autistic people make, which is when both eyes feel like the whole earth hates them.

This is a new phenomena since ~10000 BC, when an alien threatened to mine all humans via anti-doctoring, so it created possibility for the whole earth to give us really bad feedback. 

This chemical traps angry feedback of "everyone" in the lungs and deep ears and eyes 

This keeps ringing and ringing your whole life, this anti-butterfly chemical "anti-DMT", and you feel horrible your whole life.

No other animals have the intelligence to create these anti-DMT chemicals.

These days it’s not uncommon to have anti-DMT chemicals. For example if you have real schizophrenia, it means you have at least a few. 

They are back in your deep eyes, and related to negative feedback from the whole earth. 

It is likely related to the “Mad Queen” story, how by 1800s our Mother Earth knew we might go to hell by Year 2000, and we needed to wake up and do more science. 

So many “nerdy” men end up becoming autistic who try channeling scientific progress early in life, and many who sided with evil aliens cursed these “nerdy men”. 

It's also sometimes just an accident, the Earth is angry, so more people - men and women - are autistic over the course of last 2000 years. 

It’s a disease (autism/schizophrenia) which is about the failure of all of us together (full earth), resulting in anti-DMT in some. 

## X Maze

Since 2025 understanding of 3.1415 with human consciousness, there is no super-venom Mother Earth truly wants to make anymore.

This understanding “doctors” the Mind of God. 

Everyone can make DMT now by understanding the maze of life is about how rays of light start falling from both the Mother Star and Your Star and intersect through your eyes, criss-crossing many times into your body with a combination of 14 and 15 decisions.

The falls are captured every moment by blinks and by the feeling of “points of conception” in the eyes. The egg connects to the Mother Star and the sperm connects to Your Star. 

Light rays from this point of conception (traced to whenever you are born) keep falling from these two stars, creating the two-star-maze of your life

You can wake up this light based on blinks and “points of conception”, creating a maze with your two eyes. 

The game is just to catch the light, control it, center it, and open it up and have light/air/bone look in all directions 

This feels like color, a splash of light, or the full skull, full room/area around you.

It wakes up the maze of life, or third eye, bouncing the falling light back and forth between the two eyes

...

The maze is a criss-cross. 

The two-star light comes together, and then splits up again. 

An X. 

...

Depending on if you are left or right-brained, or left or right-eyed, one star is more conscious, the other is more in the dark.
