## Easiest way to get to human VR experience

Slow down the nipple air, try to have each move in 8 directions.

Slow down the eyes and understand the whites are the starmind all around you (highest in number pi), and the blacks are all the hardest bones in your body (lowest in number pi). Try to move the air between the eye whites and black eyeballs in 8 directions from this vantage point.

Then lastly, the result of the other 4 points slowed down in 8 directions, is a 5th point, which is a golden halo either buzzing as white noise in the third eye, or seeing directly into your imagination. This is because your imagination is when you look down from the top of your white halo of soul into the more complicated colors of your life, falling into colors so "alarming" they start buzzing. 

The nose air can then create a triangular version of the hypothlamus shapes in your back brain. 

When this happens, you are at start of your VR journey.
