## SPARK

SPARK = 4DR x T

Time (T), is best measured by T = c^π / c^2, or how much of π is utilized in respect to 2. The further you go down π, the older you get, bc you are further away from the original triangle.

4DR is the number of times π is used in a given system, in particular in a straight line each tick of c. On earth, this is best measured by the number of consecutive carbon elements lined up in a linear fashion.

SPARK helps us understand the potential for a system to "spark life", and also its consciousness.

Furthermore, it can be used to map where the freewill is in the system and if you have 3D vision, you can understand a star map of the system using SPARK.
