## SPARK

SPARK = 4DR x T

Time (T), is best measured by T = c^π / c^2, or how much of π is utilized in respect to 2. The further you go down π, the older you get, bc you are further away from the original triangle.

4DR is the number of times π is used in a given system, in particular in a straight line each tick of c. On earth, this is best measured by the number of consecutive carbon elements lined up in a linear fashion.
