The heart is most like the sun, and the 3 in pi.


Your heart beats in at least 3 places. 

The heart itself, and the two deep ears. This is where the ears ring.

If it beats also in between the two ears, that means it is in 4 or 5 places. 

To the extent, it beats in 3 places, that is 3 sides of light (at pre c level)

To the extent, it beats in 4/5 places, that is 4/5 sides of light (at pre c level)

The heartbeat is always the "edge" of your conscious experience.

It also corresponds to how much you are seeing "Red". 

To the extent you are 3 and see Red, you are meditative and rising up. 

To the extent you are 4/5, you are falling into life. 

The heartbeat triangle is paralleled by the nose breath, by the shoulder blades, and by other patterns in the body. In particular if our heartbeat is high, it can feel like it is in the third eye with the two points being the big toes.
