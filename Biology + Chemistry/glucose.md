## Glucose

The force of red wakes up in glucose, bc the way the electrons of glucose share is "musical". In particular, within plant life.

This also defines the taste/gradient of our goddess.

As things tend to move up to her, they tend to get "sweeter" from our perspective. 

For example, human language is sweeter versions of rudimentary noises lower life makes. And birds actually sometimes recycle human language/thinking, bc they are higher up in the mind of the earth. In other words, they are in a "sweeter section". 

Music, for example, is sweeter than regular language. This could be traced to how the patterns are more like the electrons of glucose, and the electrons of other biological chemicals on earth. 

This taste for sweetness is also a quantum gradient. It describes the ideal 4D slope of 8-5-3 time back to the star in our solar system, to our Milky Way, and back to the original 3.14 c^2 "Court Case". 

This gradient should be used going back to The Hydra/Big Bang, which is the concept of the Kindodm of Angels, ie Heaven Tower.
