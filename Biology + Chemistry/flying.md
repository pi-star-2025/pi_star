## Flying

Criss-crossing of the deep heart is most what leads to flying ability

And it’s connected to the power of walking 

Bc it most relates to the flapping of electromagnetic waves, as controlled by your soul. 

You should request that your body/soul “recycle” these deep connections, which leads to your body making automatic red/blue/green magnetic heat. Otherwise, it is biological red/blue heat, which makes you feel colder.

This can be done with deep heart-brain meditation (for example after cold water or sprinting).

While you may not build the power to fly, you will reach your full potential. It's said that raw power in the heart will most come from your deepest "pain", when you dig into the heart the most. Even just one big event.
