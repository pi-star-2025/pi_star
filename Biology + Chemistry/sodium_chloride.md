## Sodium Chloride

Taste is a parallel to god reconciling time 

Like a spider sucking blood 

So taste indicates the opinion of lower life by higher life 

For example we have opinions about earth elements that comes out in the taste of food 

Important tastes include sweet and salty 

Sweet tastes indicate the chemicals are like the primary goddess (red) 

Salty taste indicate the chemicals are like the rest of the multiverse, in contrast to our goddess (blue)

Taste for salt by biology is used to create biological fences to indicate where life is, including in nested ways. 

Taste for sugar is used to indicate where life is that represents the original goddess, such as on earth.

Sodium chloride in the eyes is used to regulate focus, whereas other chemicals like potassium can tone down focus

Sodium chloride in the oceans also regulates the focus of the earth/star mind 

...

If nitrogen gases represent the force of green

And sunny water (sugar) represents red 

Then sodium chloride with H2O represents the force of blue, acting most as the maze of life - creating the box inside the box
