## How to Fly?

Birds can fly, bc when they start to fall and ring alarms about death simulations, god will consistently approve of them pre-maturely being divine creatures. This is because of how well they represent the original intents of the universe (π).

Whenever there is an alarming simulations (about death), there is thus a chance to propose a final golden triangle (halo).

The eyes then are not alive, but are used as wings (arms/legs) to steer your vision. Your vision is completely integrated with the star’s. For birds, seeing feels like moving your wings to tilt in one direction or another.

This shows the commitment the star/original triangle has made to the direction of birds. If you get on the same page, really understanding that is the direction you are going in, you can become “final”. This should undo the knot of your belly-button, which is tied together in a strict π pattern, and instead of being ground to the earth like a seed, you will develop the ability to move through your environment more like a bird (or VR). You would not be able to give birth[^1], and have less physiological needs like sleep.

...

So in summary, if you want to fly and get to "the end of time" -> you need to make the belly-button disappear.
