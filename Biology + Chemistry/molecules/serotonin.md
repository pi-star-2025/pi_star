## Serotonin vs Pheromones

Pheromones are chemicals to create higher/lower pressure amongst a web of individuals. For example, bee stings are when pheromones create high pressure. Ant queens put pressure on workers, which gets them crawling faster.

Serotonin meanwhile stores deferred Nitrogen decisions. It actually stores why you feel more/less pressure, instead of just transmitting pressure itself.

## Low Serotonin

Low serotonin/dopamine, in regards to anxiety/depression, is about low quantum fluidity of Nitrogen decisions.

The quantum decisions of serotonin/dopamine behind the quantum mirror have got choked up. These quantum decisions are referencing millions of moments from real life, and over time the decisions are not connecting the mind enough to be happy. 

New serotonin that comes into your brain is always giving you a chance to see things differently, rewiring this quantum network behind the scenes. 

"Low serotonin" is when you don't have enough serotonin flowing in to facilitate enough "rewiring".

## Serotonin - Smell

Those who smell deeply make more serotonin and their minds have more seasonal intelligence. You  move on from things faster and with meaning

This has the effect of cooling down your body and lowering the length of your Ï€.

...

The reason is smell is the taste of longer wavelengths (mostly from the heart). It takes the electromagnetic waves of the heart (earth mind) and makes them red/blue/green "taste". This connects you to higher vision, making your whole brain/body work more like the earth.

It is also a great way to enhance your sense of directions. By adding the green to the red/blue electricity of the heart, your deeper mind has a much better sense of where you are.
