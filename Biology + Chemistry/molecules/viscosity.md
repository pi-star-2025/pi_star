## Viscosity

Viscosity indicates more quantum spinning in molecules.

Viscosity of oxygen-derived molecules indicate how much social intelligence the molecules have at a quantum level.

For example honey and saliva spin more than water, and as a result the oxygen (force of 4) has more intelligence.

Mucus has even more viscosity and as a result can store even more social intelligence.
