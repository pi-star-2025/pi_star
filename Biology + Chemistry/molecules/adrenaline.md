## Adrenaline

Neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, melatonin, and adrenaline are similar. They are all quantum music, which drill you into pi (π) more and more. However, with slightly different combinations of oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen, they create different varieties of music. 

Adrenaline, in particular, creates "marching" music, bc of emphasis on the pressure-causing elements (hydrogen/carbon). Melatonin, in contrast, applies pressure as a "lullaby", seducing you into a lower pi (π) using nitrogen/oxygen more.

Adrenaline encourages the body to squeeze/choke itself. So it is very important for waking up. 

When the heart finally squeezes its valves hard enough, that is "you" waking up. Before that, the ears, very similar in architecture to the heart valves, are squeezing and starting to wake your mind up. This is when you are "in between dreams", maybe even what you just dreamt replaying a second time.

Even before that, the adrenaline in the hypothalamus starts squeezing. You could feel it right in upper chest/sternum, or upper back. This is similar to the adrenaline birds use to fly, which clenches the hypothalamus in order to utilize matter all the way up in the atmosphere. These cloud-based valves, which the hypothalamus connects to, use the layers of the clouds as matter chutes to squeeze 8-5-3 deferred-time into your body.

When the hypothalamus starts squeezing clouds into your eyes, you start waking up. The adrenaline dominoes into the amygdala/ears, then the heart. Within an hour, to the tune of loud "marching", all the 8-5-3 Nitrogen is squeezing the valves throughout your body "by choice", giving you the energy to wake and stand.
