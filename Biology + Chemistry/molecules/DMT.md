## DMT

DMT is a sign of "sweet teeth", where different pressure levels in the Ï€ system respond with "positive" seeing decisions, indicating to the multiverse the teeth are mutual.

Teeth of pressure are important in gold systems, where different pressure levels can create more stability (shine) than unified pressure levels. "Sweet teeth" act as a measure of value added by the gold system.

Naturally our eyes store many ideas about how different pressure levels get along. In particular, they summarize your own ideas - especially if you are lucky enough to lead a joyful life.

These ideas are not perfectly understood, but like the earth, are full of quantum value, and look that way. A good moment in life is when we confirm that an idea about "sweet teeth" (different pressure levels socially) is a good one. This corresponds to the chemical DMT, which utilizes big and small carbons to mirror this symbiosis at the chemical level, which turns the quantum buzz into a gold shine.

## Nipples

The smile lines parallel both eyes. The nipples parallel both eyes individually. When a baby sucks a mother's nipple, the milk that comes out is a parallel to the clouds in the eyes. The mother enjoys the sucking on the nipples bc it can release DMT, especially when lactaiding. This can correspond to a mother seeing simulations about the child's future.
