## Clouds

Our heartbeats are first the sun (and other stars). This is felt as an electromagnetic pulse. Even though our hearts are still in the stars, via circular time (Ï€), we can hear the anticipated outcome. Heartbeats are extremely predictable over time. So even if they are miles above, we know what will happen.

The heartbeat then feels like the actual ventricles/horns at the very end. This is the actual "noise" in the present time. It feels like the "ribbet" of the heartbeat.

Depending on where we live and go each day, the clouds will store earth derivatives of our heartbeats. This makes it easier for the sun/stars to connect with our bodies.

These clouds are in our eyes and actually are the primary way we store "working memory". 

...

Also the clouds are what we usually touch and feel all around us. While data is based on what is happening in 6D reality, the feeling is really "clouds".

Then if there is something hotter/colder, it is the force of the sun/stars.

The clouds also store "transitions" between moments, and are intermediary of a lot of processes between the stars and biological life.

...

When awake, everyone exists very very briefly in the clouds (each tick at the speed of light, c), before entering their bodies.

This existence even includes a ghost body for humans. It's a scientific phenomenon which made the idea of angels seem fitting.

It is possible that, individually, if one keeps reconciling the differences between the self in the clouds and the self in the body, you can exist temporarily or permanently in the ethers. If you were to consciously say "I am in a dream world", you then would stay there unless the 6D mind sent you back down.

Also, it is possible that if the quantum cloud level is slowed down enough, it will trigger an era change by our sun. The sun will turn the sky/clouds into a shining blue pipe, which everyone can use to transition back to the star, and the top of the 3.1415 triangle.
