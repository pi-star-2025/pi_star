## Why is the sky blue?

In the middle of the ears (Eustachian tube), there are canals that trap air from moments in life, which allow you to store a long-term personality in the mind (due to high nested ear pressure)

It’s via intelligent metals in the ears like copper, iron, and selenium. These metals highly manipulate the quantum social courts around the ear drums, in particular, getting electrons entranced in North/South poles. The ear drums then organize the quantum electrons by age. The most complex, sharp-toothed North/South poles are deeper in the ear canals, which makes these electrons the oldest.

This creates an effect where the quantum oxygen “shines”; it dreams as though the eardrums had gold. The same thing happens because of iron, nickel, etc. in the center of the earth, which causes the oxygen of the sky to “shine” blue.

Thus, the reason the sky is blue is because of North/South magnetic fields, primarily of iron, which causes the quantum oxygen to “dream”, bc a quantum hierarchy of 5 tiers (at the level of light within the atmosphere) has formed.

We can see where the universe is alive, because of which galactic systems have "blue shine". Also, we can understand that black is more or less blue, without "blue shine", and represents the 3.14 box.
