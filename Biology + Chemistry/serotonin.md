## Serotonin vs Pheromones

Pheromones are chemicals to create higher/lower pressure amongst a web of individuals. For example, bee stings are when pheromones create high pressure. Ant queens put pressure on workers, which gets them crawling faster.

Serotonin meanwhile stores deferred Nitrogen decisions. It actually stores why you feel more/less pressure, instead of just transmitting pressure itself.

## Serotonin - Smell

Those who smell deeply make a lot more serotonin and their minds have more seasonal intelligence. You  move on from things faster and with meaning

This has the effect of cooling down your body and lowering the length of your Ï€.

...

The reason is smell is the taste of longer wavelengths (mostly from the heart). It takes the electromagnetic waves of the heart (earth mind) and makes them red/blue/green "taste". This connects you to higher vision, making your whole brain/body work more like the earth.

It is also the best way to enhance your sense of directions. By adding the green to the red/blue electricity of the heart, your deeper mind has a much better sense of where you are.
