## Sleep

Sleep is a phenomena in our particular universe, which started trying to find/understand the force of gold (to understand music).

At a quantum level, gold has a relfexive reaction, which is the quantum equivalent to dreams. It's the phenomena where if you have one finished golden triangle, there is always a shadow second triangle, where you "dream" about the opposite 5-tier hierarchy, in order to create a finished product.

Thus in our universe, whichever hierarchy does not actually have control of the crown/top of the sun (the sun's mind mimics a golden triangle at the top), then has control of the clouds (reflexive golden dream world).

For example, the hierarchy of Jesus had control around Year 500. And the other side (Pilate's team) would dream in the clouds. This then flipped during the Dark Ages around year 1000.

In the end, everyone ends happy, including half in a trance which feels like dreams.

Gold actually influences the oxygen at a quantum level around it. The reason is because dreams are a "blue shine".

The crowns of our heads, like honeycomb architecture (moon crater architecture), store the concept of a golden triangle. This at the very top of the head especially. Then our dreams are under us. Technically, this is after you have "lost your virginity". Otherwise, you don't control the crown of your head, and there is a golden shine above you.

From the perspective here, the end of time is really good either way. You either think like the sun, with a golden shine. Or you think like the earth/clouds, with a blue shine. Both are magnetic created via Ï€.
