## Gold

Gold uses panopticon architecture to create a hierarchy of all stars looking at it.

Using 5 shells/layers to rank the stars, and 1 electron (star) on the spot, when gold crystallizes into a solid it tells the present story of the hierarchy of the stars in our universe.

This is more prominent if the gold is shaped into a high-karat triangle, like a golden pyramid. Then you can use it to understand which stars are highest ranked, based on which ones are represented by the top of the pyramid. This representation is unveiled when studying the quantum level — meaning how the gold forms each tick of time at c.

Gold is a force of music/glory, bc it shows a harmonious reconciliation to all physical wars — chasing and being chased.

It demonstrates that using panopticon architecture, each star should be put on the spot, like a musical performance on center stage. That is the best way to create a hierarchy — high amounts of pressure and a 5-tiered system.
