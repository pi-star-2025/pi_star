## Toes

Why we sleep is one of the hardest questions to answer.

The best answer is that dreams are the natural "opposite reaction" of a "gold" society.

Biologically, it's due to melatonin, or any chemicals which make the eyes "more passive" in star game-theory.

In addition, the hypothalamus will create cages to create the living Nitrogen (ex: melanin, serotonin, dopamine, endorphins) in locked-down pressures during awake/sleeping states.

Interestingly, the secrets of how these air cages are created are in the feet. They are the lines of the feet, with the strongest pressure points in the toes.

Without the "ticklish" air in our feet, it would be much easier to go between dreams/reality.
