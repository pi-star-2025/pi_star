## The Heart

Ultimately, the part of you that is most "you" when alive is the heart it is found. 

If you consider the dream state as well, it may be the eyes, nose, hypothalamus, etc. 

But when awake, "you" are most the longest quantum wavelengths in the heart. 

So this is in the deepest part of the heart. 

This could potentially be a deep smell (like the world of dogs)

It could also be like "heart crystal" deep inside the organ, referencing the deep sun. 

Or it could "come to life" as electromagnetic red/blue waves, which are *quantum* so alive and looking to become red/blue/green.

Once they do become red/blue/green, it's said that this deep soul dies. 

The most alive parts of you often stay deepest in the heart your entire life, day after day after day.
