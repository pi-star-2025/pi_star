## Memories 

Memories/dreams/simulations are located in the concentric circles of the eyes 

Deeper in are the older memories 

On the outside are more shallow memories 

These galaxies of memories work together with new and recycled “seeing” decisions each tick of time to create your present emotions 

They are always based on a galaxy of past memories parallel to some anticipated present moment
