## Common Cold

The “common cold” can mean many things. But it is more likely to occur, when you are figuring out your level of ear-pressure (highly related to: belly-button pressure, throat pressure, nose pressure).

As children/teenagers figure out their level of ear-pressure, it relates to conflicts amongst each other -> what should be determining everyone’s pressure in our ears long-term, *who should be putting pressure on who?* 

Once, the conflicts are figured out, you are much less likely to get a “common cold”. Also, you are less likely to get ear infections and get nosebleeds. 

Really, no one has to put pressure on anyone. For example, birds all think they are equal, and without pressure can fly. 

…

The earth makes a certain amount of noise (pressure) each tick of time, at the speed of light (c).  

Different animals choose different approaches to distribute the pressure, amongst each other. For example, birds create an equal circle of shared pressure, even taking/giving at the right times, like electrons, to facilitate flying.

Bees have a queen like a star.

Some animals, like wolves, gorillas, humans have “characters” in the mind of god, who put pressure on (alpha) or take on pressure (beta).

Good meditators (ex: The Buddha, Steve Jobs, Disney) actually really lived in their own worlds, bc they were not part of the “shared network”. Most, maybe 99% of people, in some way live on a “shared network” of pressure, where everyone makes the rules together (about colors, characters, good/bad). It is based on ear pressure, created by common colds especially by age 18-21.

With good enough meditation, you are able to make your nervous system independent, and when the metallic noise blasts from the center of the earth (at c), there is no intermediaries between the center of the earth and you.

Otherwise, each tick at c, the metallic noise is twisted and siphoned, as it moves up 5-10 people. This creates complex thinking, but also thinking that is cranked into predictable patterns by 18-21. 

Hearing the pure metal in the center of the earth feels great to the ears, really healthy “like a glow” if you are really doing it. Your whole mind feels more joy, like when you are young.
