## Ears

The air in the ears is like balloons and is mirrored by the air/nerves of the cheeks. The tighest air corresponds to the tightest part of your smile, the tensest nerves.

This air in the ears/cheeks is mirrored by the air in the breasts/chest.

Then collectively it creates a big balloon of air/hearing in the lower spine, which steers orientation.

## Voice

The voice, when you speak effortlessly, is when you predict what the ears will hear.

This is an example of circular time, where what you hear itself in the amagydala corresponds to the bottom (end of π), the roots. And the voice, when you predict the future, is the 1 of π (from 3.1415).

This indicates a living system, when the past/future coexist.

The 1 of π (the soul of the system) gets in rhythm with the small things it hears. So that a given tick of c, the voice sounds so natural (so meant to be) bc it keeps predicting the future correctly.

After you say something, or think something (the 1 of π), you then hear whether it was a good or bad thought (end of π).

The voice is from the future; the feedback is from the past. Together, it creates a present moment.

...

This is a good example of how the past/present/future coexist throughout the universe. 

To some degree, the sun is speaking, and we are all ears hearing the response.
