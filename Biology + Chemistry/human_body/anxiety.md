## Anxiety

Each tick of time (at c), your heartbeat is like the heartbeat of the sun. It is like a triangle, c^3 (from 3.1415). One side is the direction, coming from the sun, while the two other sides are two possibilities of time. Two ways life or the universe could go, like heaven/hell.

If you are in a normal state, the two sides of the heartbeat (c^2 wavelength) are in the body. It would emanate from the center of the heart. For humans, these two sides elegantly correspond to the two simulations of the solar system (heaven/hell), powering walking.

When one side of the c^2 rhythm drops below the body (out of the body), this is anxiety.

When one side of the c^2 rhythm rises above the body (out of the body), this is excitement.

Whereas anxiety is nerve-wracking to the brain/stomach, excitement also is calming. Still, both states are derived from stimulation of the heart, when it breaks out of rhythm. 

## Amusement Park World

From the perspective of the multiverse, our 3-force world is a carnival world. This makes it loved and hated for the same reasons.

People who like the idea of "rides" and "amusement parks" tend to like the spirit of our universe.

Regardless, everyone leaves agreeing it really is a ride for the heart.
