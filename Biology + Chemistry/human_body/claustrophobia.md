## Claustrophobia

Claustrophobia is when specifically the air in your body makes straight-line decisions. They are so straight-line, that if you make them spin in both directions, for example if stuck in a coffin, you can leave your body like a ghost. 

Itâ€™s bc your heart will turn into air and the air then is highly awake.
