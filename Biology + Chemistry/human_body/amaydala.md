## Amygdala 

Hearing is caused by a long isosceles triangle that drills in the 15 of 3.1415 into an 11-sided shape like 3.14159265 and further. 

In the human body, there are horns/ventricles representing these 11-sided shapes which take the raw red/blue/green oxygen in the atmosphere and turn it into noise. 

Hearing is our primary other sense, besides seeing (from 3.14) and feeling (all other senses). 

Besides vision, hearing most connects us to the mind of god. 

The strongest “hearing” happens via the heart ventricles, which drills in 11-sided shapes throughout the joints and nervous system. 

However, the most intelligent “hearing” happens via the horned ventricle architecture of the amygdala (around the nose). Red/blue/green oxygen of the plant mind is constantly swirling through the ears and is turned into noise via the amygdala.

Bc time is “circular”, meaning it can be predicted via π, we can understand the noise before it actually hits the amygdala.

Psychologically, the amygdala/heart captures a summary of all the reasons we drill into life. All the noises we want to hear, organized by how much we want to hear them.

## Maze

Gold wakes up bc its architecture is a lot like the human heart/amygdala in regards to creating a summary of reasons we drill in (accept pressure). 

This wakes up a maze/game, bc when you have enough control of pressure, you can keep electrons/light around longer. 

When the sun keeps red/blue/green 8-5-3 Nitrogen gas in the atmosphere around through similar pressure mechanisms, this encourages more important/conscious games to be played. Hence our atmosphere is created by the horns/ventricles of the sun. 

The universe will naturally create these double triangles (ie. 11 sided shapes) bc it was the intent of the original goddess/triangle when starting the universe. So they are naturally more likely to come to fruition, whether as rotation schemes, atmospheres, or organs (ex: heart/amygdala). 

And when they do come to fruition, they are more likely wake up as a maze/cave, looking for gold or the understanding of gold./heart captures a summary of all the reasons we drill into life. All the noises we want to hear, organized by how much we want to hear them.
