## Hot / Cold - Pain

Across the multiverse, there is the concept of heat and biology disintegrating bc of excessive heat/time. Heat means to drill down π into higher and higher prime numbers, until it overloads and potentially pains the system.

Across many universes, heat is the same.

However, cold is more specific to our universe. Typically when you cool down a system (reduce π) it relieves pain. However, there is a concept created by insect nervous systems, where The Queen will deliver assistance to the workers. This temporarily cools down the body and mostly delivers nourishment. However, sometimes, it could deliver negative feedback (stings). This was cold and painful at the same time. This kept getting reused more and more throughout evolution on earth, until cold was the reciprocal pain to heat.

When you are cold, you loose control of the heart, and it is controlled by whoever is The Green Seer of the earth at the time, or collective network of everyone. This Green Seer can "sting" us, which gets turned into the feeling of coldness. And the parallel is that the feeling of cold is social disconnection, as well as predictable disconnection of the nervous system and blood supply.
