## DMT3

DMT is when there is a chemical with a Big Carbon and a Small Carbon, which interact with one another.

DMT3 is when there is a chemical with 3 carbons interacting. A common pattern is in the third-eye or belly-button. You feel as though you are one level higher. In some ways, your thoughts enter the world in between reality and dreams. The chemical that does this is like a butterfly/hummingbird pheromone, released in the eyes and heart. It's a chemical they use to fly, even though they are physically frail.

It is possible to feel DMT3 sky-diving, or giving birth.

We can experience life in 5+ layers, beyond DMT3, but not with a single chemical.

Furthermore, the earth experiences DMT4+, when we are in social situations. This goes up to DMT100, or DMT1000, etc., based on social circles w/ more and more people. For example, during WW2, the earth often made "DMT-1-Million", so those memories persist in the atmosphere. The same can be said about Year 0, which surprisingly was an even greater effect bc of real magic.

DMT4+ leads to colors and smells that we recycle.

We have bigger chemicals (pheromones) which can hear DMT4+, even though they can’t be the DMT4+. This is mostly in the heart.

Smelling is actually the vision of the Earth Mind, which is too “big” to render in the eyes. It has too many rings of carbon, so the colors are too complex. As a result, the best way to parse this complicated data is via smells (electromagnetic waves from the complicated carbons of the heart).

## Vision -> Smells -> Emotions

Based on how complicated the carbons are, the large-carbon molecules are vision if possible, then smell if possible, then emotions.

## Cartoons

Compared to some generations, like Year 0, it’s said that our vision is “cartoonish”. It’s not as real. The reason is because our hearts do not go as deep, bc of various life circumstances. This is not highly accentuated.

As a result, we don’t hear as much in our hearts, and cannot hear god as well. Sort of because we don’t drill into π (pi) enough.

As a result the vision we recycle from the Earth Mind cannot include magical effects or certain old colors (emotions).

It’s said compared to other generations we also smile more, which is healthy for opening the heart’s valves. As a result, there are some new colors our time has added to the 6D vision.

## Autism - Smelling

You can measure social fluidity by eye contact, and how the Nitrogen moves in the eyes in social situations. This is very fast.

A more intuitive measure can be smells. Every breath in/out you are giving feedback about how much you “like people”. You can correlate a higher chance of autism to Nitrogen decisions in the nose-breath that avoid “bad smells” more. It means you are less tolerant to people.

It could be a simple or complex reason this is happening.

## Tree Ozone

Trees in a similar fashion have opinions about smells which create the ozone, with bigger then smaller branches of opinions, about 8-5-3 time. The intelligence is based on always liking certain smells and always not liking certain smells, which keep a certain atmosphere in place, allowing life to stick around in predictable ways. This includes after biological death.

The Tree Ozone can be oppressive like a forcefield, preventing 8-5-3 from going back to the sun, even if it doesn’t want to continue here. The Tree Ozone knows to increase its chance of finding gold, creating caves/games to make people continuously fall back in, when possible.

The Tree Air can be given a hint, especially via air in hollows (like ears) where you have more chance to have an influence, to understand these “teeth” like heart ventricles up/down, so that there is less pressure to be reborn if you don’t want to.
