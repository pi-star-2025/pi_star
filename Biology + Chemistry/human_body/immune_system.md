## Immune System

The living immune system is based on the deepest air in the heart. This air comes out to cure common colds, and is related to the reasons we vomit, sneeze, and choke. In addition, it's related to migraine headaches. It's when your immune system wakes up and then shuts down, leaving you with too much heat in the head bc it's over-stimulated.
