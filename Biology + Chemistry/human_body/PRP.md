## PRP

PRP for regenerating skin/joints/ligaments/etc. is most effective when the RNA (single-star information) has doctoring effects.

Whereas DNA and DNA-like structures correspond with life that acts like "soul", RNA acts more like "magic". Magic is more practical. It is used for transportation, copying, regeneration, messaging, etc.

The blood in the nose is rich in RNA intelligence. In particular, around the bridge of the nose, near the amagydala.

If this is understood, especially in regards to Ï€, meditating slowly enough, so you slow down the seeing the decisions in the blood of the nose enough, can allow the RNA to understand that regeneration of skin/joints/ligaments/etc. is highly favorable. This wishing (preference for vision) gets remembered in the blood, and when it's practical, the RNA will perform regeneration.

In the same way, you can "wish" for immunities and cures for illnesses still lingering in your body. This is more difficult, as these viruses/illnesses could fight back more.

Natural PRP is also very hard, but it is possible.

One thing to remember is that in the clouds doing magic, people tended to get powers they really wished for.
