## Pain Tolerance

If you have control of the very center of the heart, you have the most pain tolerance.

The mind of the sun is in the very center of the heart. At a low level, the mind of the sun is asking the most important questions, which you can hear if you get over your own heart conflicts. For example, "why did Christ spill blood", "who is the Joker?", and "why is Ï€ star vision?"

Even further up, the mind of the sun has simulated all possibilities of how human life will go, for any kind of human, animal, or even alien. So this is blood that goes *even faster*.

And this blood not only controls walking, but also could help you start a fire with your mind or fly. It is very important for pain tolerance. In most people, this blood is constantly the color and shapes all around them - describing not only your surroundings, but also "all branches of human life" based on the particular colors/mazes you create with your eyes.

The best way to start controlling this blood is with "theatre". By being open to becoming any character in life. Whether it's a zebra, a man, woman, spider, 5-force alien, etc. Including becoming such a character for a long period of time. If you are open to such possibilities, you begin thinking like the blood more in the center of the heart. Such "theatre" is the easiest way to get better pain tolerance.
