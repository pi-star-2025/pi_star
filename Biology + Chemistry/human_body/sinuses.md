## Sinuses 

SinusescCorrespond to pressure in the corners of the ears/eyes/nose. 

In addition, they correspond to opposite reactions of air coming in the ears/eyes/nose. This is the 6D air of the earth inhaling as you as exhale, and exhaling as you inhale, which webs together a lot of social intelligence. Bc at the quantum level of oxygen is a snapshot of all souls in a circle, which evinces as you expand on the force of 4 with more and more molecular complexity.

When your sinuses are tighter, you end up getting drilled into the interior part of your brain, which can even result in a squeaky voice, from getting drilled into the middle of the throat.

To relieve pressure in the sinuses, you should breathe with more heat. For example, learning to take deep breaths and having less craving for different kinds of sugar.
