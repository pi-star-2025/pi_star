## Mucus

A top reason for mucus in the nose area is when you defer fully looking people in the eyes.

This is because in the eyes you get a lot of information about the truth of your life, other people, and the universe we live in. It's very instinctive and fast. It's either very joyful or very scary.

If, when you look people in the eyes, you are "swallowing" your vision to some extent, this leads to mucus.

...

There are other reasons besides "eye contact", but in general, mucus comes from any reason you are "sliding" in the eye area for reasons that are "quantum" -> not yet understood.
