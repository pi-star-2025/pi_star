## Lower Spine

The lower spine most encodes ego in the body, a strong desire to keep being a certain kind of person.

This is because the lower spine most resembles intelligent stone/boulder, which uses gravity to emphasize "stubborness" regarding a way of seeing.

It is the part of you that least has a sense of humor because it is the least gas driven.
