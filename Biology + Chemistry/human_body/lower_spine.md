## Lower Spine

The lower spine most encodes ego in the body, a strong desire to keep being a certain kind of person.

This is because the lower spine most resembles intelligent stone/boulder, which uses gravity to emphasize "stubborness" regarding a way of seeing.

It is the part of you that least has a sense of humor because it is the least gas driven.

...

One principle to remember in nature is that what is most solid in nature most is created by "everyone" (a consensus). And what is most like gas (or light) is what is most individualistic.

So opinions in the lower spine relate to strong ideas about how you to relate to "everyone".

Similarly, mountains or moons are good way to understand how "everyone" is thinking, whereas individuals stars in the sky represent a particular "seer" or "court of opinion".
