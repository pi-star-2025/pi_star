## Soul Mate

Across the multiverse, if you use the force of "green" or "planting" life moves in seasons. Healthy systems move quantum biology and quantum life through stages, which are similar to spring/summer/fall/winter. Planting/up/down/death.

When quantum time which is alive/social is un-seasonal and gets stuck in the body/mind this is associated with OCD/low serotonin.

If time has become unseasonal in a way that is causing joy, and if this soul is not you, then it could be a daemon, a doctor (benevolent force), or potentially a soul-mate.

This time would exist as half-reconciled magnetic shine, which partially can exist in the body, often right inside the ears or in the heart, or peaking out of the imagination.

It's true that some bird species will have one specific "partner" that keeps them in line, in regards to both flying and communication.

Bc it's mathematically sound, it's a way to exist more where life is mathematically sound.
