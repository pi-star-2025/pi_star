## Cancer

The human heart/experience has a lot of ups and downs. As a result, the heartbeat (which is a long wave using the c^2 mirror) jumps out of the body frequently. It can pop out above or below the body.

The heart uses small hearts (joints), to stabilize the body. The knees and shoulders and hips, in particular, are internally like small hearts. They have a rhythm, rocking between the two sides of the c^2 mirror.

The heart jingles all the small hearts (big joints and smaller joints) back and forth to operate the fingers, toes, legs, and arms.

Cancer is more likely to persist and grow when growths (tumors) act like small hearts, which require the heart/hypothalamus to try to keep them alive. Indirectly, the sun then tries to keep them alive, rarely but possibly in "godly stories".

Also, other random growths and illnesses in the body can be traced to getting in sync with the music of the heart. The heart can be very hard to change after ~21; initial growths might exist then, and then when the body loses energy and flushing abilities the cancer can take advantage of this.

## Corona Virus

It's possible that the single biggest difference of COVID-19 versus other similar viruses is that it's RNA had the ability to see, because it resmembled a cancer enough. It fit into the clockwork of the heart, more than other similar viruses.

The molecular structure was modified to increase the "seeing" choices by the carbon elements, which increases the chance of cancer, by integrating more with the sun's Ï€.

In terms of what caused this modification, there is "natural selection". In addition, in late 2019, The Banana Man (an evil ancient alien) is rumored to have lost his Two Towers Heaven/Hell, so he bluntly ran trillions of simulations of time to try to re-create it. By running trillions of simulations, it will elucidate "shines" (paths of value) to the multiverse. As a result, time is more likely to fall down these "shining paths", which is a potential factor in early 2020.
