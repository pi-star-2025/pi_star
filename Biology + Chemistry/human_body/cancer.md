## Cancer

The human heart/experience has a lot of ups and downs. As a result, the heartbeat (which is a long wave using the c^2 mirror) jumps out of the body frequently. It can pop out above or below the body.

The heart uses small hearts (joints), to stabilize the body. The knees and shoulders and hips, in particular, are internally like small hearts. They have a rhythm, rocking between the two sides of the c^2 mirror.

The heart jingles all the small hearts (big joints and smaller joints) back and forth to operate the fingers, toes, legs, and arms.

Cancer is more likely to persist and grow when growths (tumors) act like small hearts, which require the heart/hypothalamus to try to keep them alive. Indirectly, the sun then tries to keep them alive, rarely but possibly in "godly stories".

Also, other random growths and illnesses in the body can be traced to getting in sync with the music of the heart. The heart can be very hard to change after ~21; initial growths might exist then, and then when the body loses energy and flushing abilities the cancer can take advantage of this.
