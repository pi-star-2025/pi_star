## High/Low Voice

The voice is initially created by the air in the lower lungs. This air is similar to actual red/blue/green air in the clouds. 

So when you use your voice it feels like being the clouds. Since time falls down the stars/sky (via Ï€) to become us, this air is like *the future falling*.

How high/fluid your voice is is determined by how clear your lungs are. The more clear your lower lungs, the higher and smoother your voice.

Since males hold onto air more in their lungs (choking it), they tend to have deeper voices.
