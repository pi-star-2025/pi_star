## Hunger

Hunger can help us understand pi (π), bc it describes the metal-driven quantum gravity down the number. 

The number is very "hungry" to find gold, which is sparse in the core of the earth, and similar to combinations of other metals (ex: iron, nickel, selenium). 

We really like gold, bc the behavior of its electrons is described by a straight line after 3.14159265 of π. This even includes certain games/seductions to look for gold, in order to achieve the original goals of the universe to harmonize red/blue/gold.

We share a similar hunger to find gold, which includes a pull to the center of earth, manifested as hunger.

Thirst, lust, and other core emotions are similar, pulling us via π to the center of the earth to find gold. 

Antigravity/cold fusion is then mathematical answers that go in a straight line up π.
