## Moons

Moons are used as rocks that a given planet wants to copy. For example, our earth moon encapsulates scientific intelligence in a small form. Our earth/sun chooses it as a moon so that all plants and animals can copy the ideas of the moon.

Both our stomach/skull minds copy the moon's geology as a result. So does the crown of trees, the heads of flowers, the faces of animals, etc.

The sun uses all planets as ears, to potentially hear "space rocks" that can be added for intelligence. The earth a) constantly hears our single moon, b) listens for potential other moons.

So do all other planets in our universe. Some planets like Jupiter use multiple moons for multiple kinds of intelligence, and if life had developed on Jupiter it could be correspondingly complex.

## Three Ears

Our two ears are constantly listening for "new" ideas. We use them to primarily to hear social information, big and small.

Our belly button is a third ear constantly listening to either a) the stomach, b) the skull, c) the sun. It depends on what we designate as the "moon". We get to designate 1 "moon" like the earth, via the third ear.

Trees only have 1 ear, like the earth/moon. They use it to point to themselves, including in forest patterns. This creates the carbon-dioxide-based ozone. The trees can point to the sun as well, which can turn the ozone to gold.

The reason is bc "cold fusion" is whenever what is "cold" copies the star (based on Ï€). By designating the sun as the "moon" this could create cold fusion from life on earth.
