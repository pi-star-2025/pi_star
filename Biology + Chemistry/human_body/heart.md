## Heart

The original 3.14 triangle (π) has two eyes of the original goddess that look at "all matter" of the multiverse.

This means that it is an isosceles triangle, with the 2 points of the 3 looking at the 1 point of the 4.

When the multiverse looks back it creates a c^2 mirror and the blue 3.14 box within a red triangle.

Each tick of time, from the triangle's perspective large wavelengths from the 2 eyes fall into smaller wavelengths. Via circular time of π, the larger and smaller wavelengths coexist.

The larger wavelengths are a core message (to understand red/blue/gold), and the smaller wavelengths are a response.

The human heart is geometrically oriented the same way. The heart is a triangle, with the top as 2 points looking down at a single point.

The human heart is an intricate, detailed map of the entire nervous system, with the top wired to the nerves around the eyes/skull and the bottom wired to the heals/toes.

In regards to wavelengths, the top of the heart is the Era message from the sun. This is the latest Era message the sun sent us, estimated to be ~Year 0, about Heaven/Hell, angels/demons. And the bottom of the heart is what specifically drills most into π. On earth, this is a quest to synchronize/harmonize heavy metals (iron/nickel/gold/copper) in ways the multiverse finds musical.

For example, this musical nature of metals mirrored by the bottom heart is important for walking.
