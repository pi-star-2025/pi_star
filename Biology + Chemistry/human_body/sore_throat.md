## Sore Throat

Sore throat is not an accident, when you get a fever. Viruses are able to use the throat, even the Adam’s apple, as a “sac”, which the immune system/heart figures out when you get a fever.

Viruses use the throat to make very strong connections to the nose/eyes/ears/heart/teeth. The throat has the ability to store complex ideas at a low level. 

Interestingly, this is because the throat has so much more freewill and depth than humans have ever used. There is many combinations we don’t touch, even living 100+ years. These are combinations deepest in the throat, and viruses (sometimes representing malevolent stars) are there every day “in the dark” using this space.
