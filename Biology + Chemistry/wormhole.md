## Wormhole

Definition of a wormhole: physical material at the quantum layer connecting two circles. This is often 5D/6D interactions. 

For example, a wormhole can connect a 4D and 6D circle. 

And the simplest definition of how to "spark life" is about how to get a wormhole spinning. 


# The Smile

The smile mirrors the center of the heart. 

Also, it parallels the wormhole between you and the sun (4D and 6D). It feels like a worm, and has the architecture of a worm’s body. 

It is most useful for understanding your “role” from the sun, and your “character” together.
