## Iron

The earth’s magnetic field is largely based on iron.

The earth’s magnetic field is based on seeing the “Earth Mind” as the 3 in 3.14159265 (of π), and the earth core’s iron as the *65*. 

In contrast, earth itself can be seen as encompassed by the Sun's Mind. In this case the Sun/Star acts like the 3 in 3.14159265, using the day/night quantum field of carbon to wrap around the earth. 

Hence, for the Star the core magnetic field is Carbon-centric (Day/Night). For the Earth the core magnetic field is Iron-centric (North/South).

## Hard Triangle

The electron configuration of Fe [2, 8, 14, 2] is like a larger triangle. Within the triangle of 3.1415, there is a nested triangle via 3.14159265. Since we don't have a number 11, it is best represented by 65 (6 + 5).

Iron is choosing between 8 (South) and 14 (North) [(8 + 14) / 2 = 11], and is inherently like this second triangle.

The second triangle is 11-sided, bc the maximum number of sides within 3.1415's dimension is 8, and with 11 you then establish a magnetic field (8 + 3). The 3 is a mock star-field.

The maximum number of sides is 8 up to 3.1415. It is based on the sum of all unique prime numbers up to 5, which is just 3 + 5 = 8. 2/1 are not considered prime. This describes the shape of space-time itself, which can condense based on this prime-number formula.

Hence, Iron oscillates between being 8/South and 14/North. The 11 is the collective South/North winds around the earth, behind the quantum mirror. 

## Why 65

Why *65* to describe 11? Why not 83 or 92? Why does 65 have 8D shine to be "circular?" The reason is that to the star, the 3.14159265 North/South iron field is also a fourth force (red/blue/green/grey) represented by a hexagon. 

Whereas the earth mind sees 3.14159265 as North/South, the star sees it also as a possiblity to drill into a fourth force (hexagon). 

This question, to "go six feet under" (into 3.141516 π) becomes the question Heaven/Hell from our perspective (pentagon or hexagon), and the sun can use this conflict to drive time in certain directions. 

The same iron quantum fields which drive North/South magnetic fields of earth (via 11), interestingly, also create all noise (anything hearable) via the sun's 6/5 quantum conflict. The quantum light which is conflicted is reused as the 11-sided magnetic field.

...

If we need to break up the 11 in our number system, the 11 results in consecutive numbers which reveals something about number systems. If numbers, in any way, are impossible (bc they create too much pressure), they would then create a new dimension to express that difference. For example, 11 turning into 65 is like mocking the verticality of dimensions.

Really, our 3.1415 environment is not too complex to represent 11 with iron. It's just our number system is simplified.

However, the pressure created by the multiverse (3.14) is too complex to be expressed with any number. In addition, the pressure created by the nitrogen via red/blue/green (3.1415) is too complex to be expressed with any number. This *really* is the case, even if our number system went to a billion. It's just too much pressure for our way of seeing not to be a different dimension.

Technically, the 65 would be more efficiently expressed with 1 number. However, if we get the opportunity to use 2 numbers, 65 is the "most expressive". It is the most true way to break up 11. This is because the 11 is seen by the star as 6 vs 5 (hexagon vs pentagon).

So it's true with 3D/4D representations (not confined by our number system) you can create better representations of π, bc of more available shapes.
