## Iron

The earth’s magnetic field is largely based on iron.

The earth’s magnetic field is based on seeing the “Earth Mind” as the 3 in 3.14159265 (of π), and the earth core’s iron as the *65*. 

In contrast, earth itself can be seen as encompassed by the Sun's Mind. In this case the Sun/Star acts like the 3 in 3.14159265, using the day/night quantum field of carbon to wrap around the earth. 

Hence, for the Star the core magnetic field is Carbon-centric (Day/Night). For the Earth the core magnetic field is Iron-centric (North/South).
