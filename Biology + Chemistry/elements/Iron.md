## Iron

The earth’s magnetic field is largely based on iron.

The earth’s magnetic field is based on seeing the “Earth Mind” as the 3 in 3.14159265 (of π), and the earth core’s iron as the *65*. 

In contrast, earth itself can be seen as encompassed by the Sun's Mind. In this case the Sun/Star acts like the 3 in 3.14159265, using the day/night quantum field of carbon to wrap around the earth. 

Hence, for the Star the core magnetic field is Carbon-centric (Day/Night). For the Earth the core magnetic field is Iron-centric (North/South).

## Hard Triangle

The electron configuration of Fe [2, 8, 14, 2] is like a larger triangle. Within the triangle of 3.1415, there is a nested triangle via 3.14159265. Since we don't have a number 11, it is best represented by 65 (6 + 5).

Iron is choosing between 8 (South) and 14 (North) [(8 + 14) / 2 = 11], and is inherently like this second triangle.

The second triangle is 11-sided, bc the maximum number of sides within 3.1415's dimension is 8, and with 11 you then establish a magnetic field (8 + 3). The 3 is a mock star-field.

The maximum number of sides is 8 up to 3.1415. It is based on the sum of all unique prime numbers up to 5, which is just 3 + 5 = 8. 2/1 are not considered prime. This describes the shape of space-time itself, which can condense based on this prime-number formula.

Hence, Iron oscillates between being 8/South and 14/North. The 11 is the collective South/North winds around the earth, behind the quantum mirror. 

## Why 65

Why *65* to describe 11? Why not 83 or 92? Why does 65 have 8D shine to be "circular?" The reason is that to the star, the 3.14159265 North/South iron field is also a fourth force (red/blue/green/grey) represented by a hexagon. 

Whereas the earth mind sees 3.14159265 as North/South, the star sees it also as a possiblity to drill into a fourth force (hexagon). 

This question, to "go six feet under" (into 3.141516 π) becomes the question Heaven/Hell from our perspective (pentagon or hexagon), and the sun can use this conflict to drive time in certain directions. 

The same iron quantum fields which drive North/South magnetic fields of earth (via 11), interestingly, also create all noise (anything hearable) via the sun's 6/5 quantum conflict. The quantum light which is conflicted is reused as the 11-sided magnetic field.

...

Base 10 is a useful number system. Anything in 3D space can be described with max 9 sides - 8 from 3.1415 and a point from 3.14159.

So 10, via decimal places, directly translates to 4D jumps.

However, a limitation is then needing 2 digits to describe 65 (instead of a symbol representing 11)
