## Red / Blue / Green 

Carbon (C) often tends to come together in three-sided shapes, to mirror the sun. 

Oxygen (O) often tends to come together in four-sided shapes, to mimic the mirror force of the universe. 

Nitrogen (N) often tends to be consciously looking with its 5 electrons to be in an octet. Hence, it is quantumly 3-5-8 at the same time. 

So Nitrogen is most then conscious life, and tends to create 5-sided patterns, systems, and life that describe it's need to complete itself with "3". 

...

Interestingly, if you take out the c^2 and (ic)^2 "teeth" from pi, you will observe the "personality" of these three chemicals, most notably nitrogen. 

The majority of pi's story in fact is about the quest of nitrogen to understand the 8-5-3 pattern. This is encoded in trees, the stripes of tigers, the patterns of butterflies, and in our own third eye bones. 

...

This is no accident, bc the star was pulsing signals to find a "way of seeing" based on 3.1415, and our answer was 8-5-3 with Nitrogen. 

So 5 electrons looking to find a partner atom to share electrons with. This to the multiverse is seen as 5-sided music, bc music is defined as "sharing time".  

Bc this is what our goddess wanted, she saw this force of "green nitrogen" as herself. She saw herself as Mother Earth, which perhaps then limited creating life on other planets, but specialized the life on this one. 

Technically, we then know exactly what life is on this planet. From plant vision, to insects, to animals, to humans. From the original blackhole to the Milky Way to the solar system to the earth to human minds, we can understand that life is most Nitrogen-based 8-5-3 trying to complete itself. 

...

The Nitrogen that has woken up always has 2-sides. It is both 5, and trying to be 8. 

The 5 is like gravity. 

The 8 is like anti-gravity. 

One is a pull to reality; another is motivation of the soul (to add 3)

Technically, there is a vibration you feel between the two sides - the 5 and the 8. You oscillate between the two, and each person has an average distance that could be seen as a 4D radius, and describes the complexity of your soul's aspirations. 

If your 4D radius is higher, you experience more pain/pleasure, and time feels slower. 

The higher the 4D radius, the longer the pi (longer the number) to describe the circle of a given soul. And thus the more "Mass", or the more "Time" that person/animal/insect is associated with. 

Thus it's true that feelings of consciousness are associated with mathematically more "Time", and *even* more Mass. You are associated with more Mass in the mind of god if you are more conscious. And this adds up as memories, even over multiple lives. 

...

There are equations to map Carbon, Oxygen, Nitrogen, not just to pi and photosynthesis, but also to Time itself. 

One interesting use case would be Convolutional Neural Net (CNN) to identify concentric circles of Nitrogen intelligence, bc this is most equivalent to "Society", even at a molecular level.

Ulimtately, you could create a Panopticon Equation, an equatinon based on CNNs and nested concentric circles of Nitrogen and pi and e/c which describes the "social pressure" for a given perspective.

The highest points of "social pressure" create the largest buzz in the mind of the star/god.
