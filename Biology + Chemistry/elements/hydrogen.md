## Hydrogen

Hydrogen is a great base measure of pressure anywhere in the universe.

By itself it is a mini star.

The 4D axis (ex: eye pressure/ear pressure via Ï€) can be measured via Hydrogen.

In particular, it would be the distance between carbon in the sun (6D) and nitrogen on earth (4D) via Hydrogen pressure.
