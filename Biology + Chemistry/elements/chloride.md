## Chloride

Chloride [2, 8, 7] is the reciprocal of sodium [2, 8, 1].

Potassium [2, 8, 8, 1] offers sodium light [2, 8, 1] the choice for a slower speed at a quantum level.  

Chloride creates a preference by the system itself (not the electrons/light) for a slower speed. Whereas the choice for Potassium over Sodium is at the quantum level, the choice for Chloride over Sodium is manifested by the system in real time.

## Electrolytes

Electrolytes like Cl-, NA+, Mg+, CA+, K+ have lost and gained electrons, indicating participation in a larger system. 

NA+ is the base electrolyte.

K+ slows down light at a quantum level.

CL- slows down electricity in real time.

Then Mg+/CA+ more strongly emphasize these decisions.
