## Temperature

Mercury is a great measure of pressure. 

It’s not good to have in the body, as it shows an accumulation of pressure.

The reason it’s a good measure of pressure is that it is the second chemical after gold to capture the idea of temperature (hot/cold) via 5 shells/layers of electrons.

The [2, 8, 18, 32, 18, 2] configuration represents a stable choice between pressures, enabling hold/cold symbiotic relationships between different stars, including our sun. If pressure choices are symbiotic (high/low) this creates temperature.

If different stars prefer different quantum properties they can coexist. At the elemental level, this makes an element (ex: Mercury) more dynamic to different pressures/temperatures.

## 5 Layers

Why is Mercury’s electron configuration [2, 8, 18, 32, 18, 2]?

It’s because the latter 18 (after 32) makes the 32 a “circle”, which has its own π that the last 2 is a part of. 

This creates then 5 levels of pressure, with 18 actually being higher than 32. This allows the last 2 to measure a range of pressures. When it is a single electron in gold [2, 8, 18, 32, 18, 1], it then represents the various stars’ opinions on the 5-tiered pressure.

It also demonstrates that in Mercury/Gold, the 32 electrons act as both hot and cold. Some stars in our universe do the same thing (seeing and anti-seeing, pressure and anti-pressure).

Awareness of temperature is the sign of an intelligent “seer” (star) in our universe. 

Still, having Mercury in the body is not a good sign, as it creates too much complication.
