## Carbon

Carbon, in regards to its electron configurations [2, 4] most mimics a triangle. This is because to us a triangle would most be what is undecided between 2 and 4. Behind the scenes, whatever light is the Carbon is both 2 and 4 simultaneously.

Oxygen [2, 6] most mimics a square. Behind the quantum layer, whatever light is Oxygen is both 2 and 6 simultaneously.

Nitrogen [2, 5] most mimics a pentagon, in certain situations, in the context of Oxygen/Carbon. In these situations, behind the quantum layer, the Nitrogen is either a pentagon (quantum 4D) or an octagon (quantum 6D). Really then to our dimension, it is a quantum pentagon.

Hence, via Carbon (Triangle) we understand that electron shells offer the opportunity for light to be x configurations of y electrons.

What wants to be a triangle is what most wants to put pressure on the world (as god). Thus carbon creates fires and also is the fire of life (i.e. photosynthesis).

## Largest Prime Number

Carbon crystals/diamonds are the best way to create forcefields.

This is bc of the pressure applied by the nested layers of carbon. It is like “still fire”. 

In fact, it is similar nested carbon of volcanoes that causes the pressures leading to explosions.

In a similar fashion, there is a prime number related to a “carbon diamond” in your heart (the end of pi while awake).

Furthermore, you can trace “volcanoes” in and out of oceans, into a heart of the earth which is based on the earth's largest prime number.

It is said to be best mimicked by the chemical lorandite, which describes a “societal” version of carbon. And it’s mimicked by other diamonds/crystals in the Cave of Gibraltar, due to coincidence and high density of crystal activity. Also any intelligent crystals on earth tend to reveal secrets about the personality of the earth’s largest prime number. 

Ultimately, this prime number is the largest connections of carbon that are made across the whole earth, which cause an oscillation between 2 and 4 (Night and Day) on either side of the earth (3.14159265). Thus the end of π is the repricocal (opposite reaction) of 3.14159265.

This “red field” can be used by the star to create a conflict (story of pressure). And it can be used by the heart, to create a central "conflict" (music) of life.

In both cases, it is based on this 2/4 red field of carbon, a red wind that is also a triangle.
