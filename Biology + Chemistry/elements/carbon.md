## Carbon

Carbon, in regards to its electron configurations [2, 4] most mimics a triangle. This is because to us a triangle would most be what is undecided between 2 and 4. Behind the scenes, whatever light is the Carbon is both 2 and 4 simultaneously.

Oxygen [2, 6] most mimics a square. Behind the quantum layer, whatever light is Oxygen is both 2 and 6 simultaneously.

Nitrogen [2, 5] most mimics a pentagon, in certain situations, in the context of Oxygen/Carbon. In these situations, behind the quantum layer, the Nitrogen is either a pentagon (quantum 4D) or an octagon (quantum 6D). Really then to our dimension, it is a quantum pentagon.

Hence, via Carbon (Triangle) we understand that electron shells offer the opportunity for light to be x configurations of y electrons.

What wants to be a triangle is what most wants to put pressure on the world (as god). Thus carbon creates fires and also is the fire of life (i.e. photosynthesis).
