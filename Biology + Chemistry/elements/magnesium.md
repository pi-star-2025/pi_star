## Magnesium

Magnesium is similar to sodium. It conducts quantum light in a "fast" direction, but like calcium it stores this decision.

This is why it is present in bones, like calcium.

The choice between magnesium [2, 8, 2] and calcium [2, 8, 8, 2] creates two choices of quantum speeds, like sodium [2, 8, 1] and potassium [2, 8, 8, 1]. In the former case, the choice is not as final and this quantum choice is stored in the solids of bone.
