## Iodine

Iodine is a reciprocal of silver. Silver is a mirror for light, whereas iodine is a chokehold for light. In both cases, the [18, 18] electron center enforces that this is a preference in some way by the starlight.

As a result, iodine is used by clams/oysters to systematically lock their shells, opening and closing based on moon cycles. In addition, iodine is used by the hypothalamus/ears to lock in certain trances of life (night/day, walking, happy/sad, under pressure/relaxed, etc.). 

Secrets/encryption of systems like clams/oysters are encoded via iodine chains, a sequential list of reasons to choke the systemâ€™s light.
