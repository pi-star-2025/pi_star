## Potassium

The red/blue/green mind moves in two core directions.

The first is down in the direction of potassium, where 8-5-3 time makes decisions that reduce quantum speed.

The second is in the direction of sodium, where 8-5-3 time makes decisions that increase quantum speed.

The former is described by the characteristics of fruits; the latter is described by the characteristics of oceans. The first is the personality of the sun slowed down; the second is the personality of the multiverse.

Potassium for 4D/6D red/blue/green circles moves quantum speed down.

Sodium for 4D/6D red/blue/green circles moves quantum speed up.

This creates a photonic (light) preference for one speed or another[^1]. 

Also, with biological life there are two core personalities. One is blue going up; the other is pink (slow red) going down.

## 3.1415

Potassium describes 3.14 in a unique way. 

The nucleus (outer electron) and 2 electrons are a triangle.

Then you describe c^2, or 4^2, with the middle 16 electrons [2, 8, 8, 1].

Sodium meanwhile has 8 middle electrons [2, 8, 1], bc it has *not* slowed down the c^2 mirror.

Hence, *really* sodium describes 3.14, whereas potassium describes 3.1415.

In this case, the .15 element is derived from whatever uses potassium as its compass.

In this case, nitrogen decisions reference the NA+/K+ fast/slow quantum current, using NA+/K+ as the core "magnetic" field for red/blue/green vision at the 4D level.

...

[2, 8, 1] with 8 (4 + 4) references a quantum 4 decision described by ocean waves.

[2, 8, 8 1] with 16 (4 + 4 + 4 + 4) references deferring and never deciding.

The first is not alive without the second.

And the second depends on nitrogen [2, 5] as the seer, the .15 in Ï€.

[^1]: At a quantum level [2, 8, 1] comes together faster than [2, 8, 8 1]
