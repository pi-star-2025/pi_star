## Potassium

The red/blue/green mind moves in two core directions.

The first is down in the direction of potassium, where 8-5-3 time makes decisions that always reduce electrical current.

The second is in the direction of sodium, where 8-5-3 time makes decisions that always increase electrical current.

The former is described by the characteristics of fruits; the latter is described by the characteristics of oceans. The first is the personality of the sun slowed down; the second is the personality of the multiverse.

Potassium for 4D/6D red/blue/green circles moves electrical currents down.

Sodium for 4D/6D red/blue/green circles moves electrical currents up.

This is due strictly due to a photonic (light) preference for one speed or another. 

Also, with biological life there are two core personalities. One is blue going up; the other is pink (slow red) going down.

## 3.1415

Potassium describes 3.14 in a unique way. 

The nucleus (outer electron) and 2 electrons are a triangle.

Then you describe c^2, or 4^2, with the middle 16 electrons.

Sodium meanwhile has 8 middle electrons, bc it has *not* slowed down the c^2 mirror.

Hence, *really* sodium describes 3.14, whereas potassium describes 3.1415.

In this case, the .15 element is derived from whatever uses potassium as its compass.

In this case, nitrogen decisions reference the sodium/potassium +/- electrical current, which means that sodium/potassium is the core "magnetic" field for red/blue/green vision at the 4D level.
