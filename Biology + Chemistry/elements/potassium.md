## Potassium

The red/blue/green mind moves in two core directions.

The first is down in the direction of potassium, where 8-5-3 time makes decisions that always reduce electrical current.

The second is in the direction of sodium, where 8-5-3 time makes decisions that always increase electrical current.

The former is described by the characteristics of fruits; the latter is described by the characteristics of oceans. The first is the personality of the sun slowed down; the second is the personality of the multiverse.

Potassium for 4D/6D red/blue/green circles moves electrical currents down.

Sodium for 4D/6D red/blue/green circles moves electrical currents up.

This is due strictly due to a photonic (light) preference for one speed or another. 

Also, with biological life there are two core personalities. One is blue going up; the other is pink (slow red) going down.
