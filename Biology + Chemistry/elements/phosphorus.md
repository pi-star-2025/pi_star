## Mushrooms 

Some mushrooms have super hearing abilities.

The reason is because phosphorus in the fungal networks and mushrooms acts a mirror element, absorbing and projecting red/blue/green messages.

When this mirror element was incorporated like bones into the living plant mind, it started sending/receiving messages. 

## Quantum matter

Phosphorus in biological organisms also helps the living organism keep track of what they have seen. Soul stored in the body (related to 8-5-3 deferred time) is associated with phosphorus-rich systems, like bones, to understand what needs to be seen “more”. 

Hence, 8-5-3 time at the quantum level resembles phosphoric systems on earth.
