## Calcium

Calcium is a "milky mirror" bc it best creates a quantum mirror with two outer electrons. It is a root form of pleasure/satisfaction with the earth.

Calcium is an example of a mirror that can capture a slowed down version of red/blue/green, which allows it to then understand gold. It is naturally opalescent.

Ghosts are calcium/phosphorus gas, common in the 6D mind.

Opalescence via a milky mirror and red/blue/green (like oyster pearls/Mother of Pearl) is considered gold to the multiverse. We can tell the force of gold has woken up, bc of dreams (the opposite reaction of society, a feature only present in "gold" 5-tier societies). So the milky mirror of calcium was sufficient.
