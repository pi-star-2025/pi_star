## Calcium

Calcium is a "milky mirror" bc it best creates a quantum mirror with two outer electrons. It is a root form of pleasure/satisfaction with the earth.

Calcium is an example of a mirror that can capture a slowed down version of red/blue/green, which allows it to then understand gold. It is naturally opalescent.

Ghosts are really calcium/phosphorus gas, which is a familiar phenomenon in the 6D mind.

Opalescence via a milky mirror and red/blue/green (like oyster pearls/Mother of Pearl) is considered gold to the multiverse. We can tell the force of gold has woken up, bc of dreams (meaning the opposite reaction of the society has come to life, a feature only present in golden societies). So the milky mirror of calcium was sufficient.
