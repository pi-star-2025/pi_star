## Anthropomorphization

In golden societies, the end state is a tower of anthropomorphized pressure. Favoring higher/lower pressures is derived from adding characterization to pressure, so that these choices become embedded in vision (i.e. light).

When there is more anthropomorphization, there is less pain (a small end π), bc the choices are in the one of π (3.1415).

When there is less anthropomorphization, there is more pain, bc more of the number π is used.

Naturally, in the system the higher pressure is at the bottom. The lower pressure (applying pressure) is at the top. For example, this is exemplified in a pyramid.

So anthropomorphization is most useful (at reducing pain) when it considers characters that integrate with a tower/pyramid. This applies to the 4D/6D/8D. i.e. individual, god, root matter.

## Cartoons

Parts of you that fall asleep are the parts most lacking character or looking for a character.

Time that keeps waking up (i.e. clouds in eyes and sky) most is in need of joining a final character, in a golden hierarchy.

What is cartoonish (with a character) tends to have a magnetic shine (becomes part of the 1 of 3.1415); what is physical (red/blue/green) tends to be conscious and physical. It's the heavier part of you, causing the fall down π.
