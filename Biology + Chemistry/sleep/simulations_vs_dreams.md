## Simulations vs Dreams

When you sleep, you both dream and simulate real life.

These simulations use memories that go up to your death line and help you practically in reality.

As soon as you *stop stimulating reality*, you then become part of the earth mind, your carbon chains (SPARK) are significantly longer like a plant, and you are really dreaming.

These dreams are based on your memories and include multiple individuals. Sometimes the dream can be based on a moment from *your life*, sometimes a moment from another's. 

The collective plant mind/earth mind does *one thing* when dreaming. It uses memories to simulate the future, but instead of simulating one person's future, the earth mind simulates the future of the entire planet.

...

These earth simulations have the feel of movies or TV shows. Nevertheless, there is always a specific question or purpose the seer had when initiating a dream.

Dreams are much more fun than reality. In a low 3-force world, it's always messy finding characters, so your truer character is likely to come out above.
