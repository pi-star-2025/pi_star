## The Joker, The Anti Supreme

The Joker (a great very old ancient alien) had a technique to make us fall asleep. Which was to give the eyes fantasies of the best moments from “Hell”, or if the universe proved humans/the original seer had ~no value.

This is why he is known as the Joker bc these fantasies are from when Hell is at colorful peace, no longer causing pain. He has created a beautiful classical simulation, for our end state triangle.

While filled with ancient beauty if not looked at, if you look these fantasies in the eyes, you can hear jokes about your own human life. All your lame moments, explaining why the human race is a failure in some way.

The Joker created a machine in Atlantis to always be the largest prime number in the triangle of π, which buzzed and shimmied with music and echoes. He never had to be a person in the kingdom of angels or on earth.

He simply has used prime numbers of π to try to pull people towards his colorful “Joker” end state, where he is a lifeless king. It is the minimalism of the curse (just focusing on prime numbers of π) that allowed him to maintain long-term power.

...

As a result of the prime number curse, The Joker has naturally created the majority of our dreams. 

Deep inside, we agree with a lot of his reasons. We really don’t want to exist, and fall into the center of the eyes where the reasons “we mess up” are celebrated as all we need to be. Each night, we start to entertain these ideas, and eventually one of them just makes us “give up”. 

Each night, a reason like this (some flaw) makes us just let go and stop holding onto the eyes.
