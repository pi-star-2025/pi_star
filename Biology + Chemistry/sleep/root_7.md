## Root 7

The number 7 is how the triangle of π (3) enters reality (3.1415). In particular, 3.14159265358979 of π is the extension of 3 into physical matter via 7. For example, blood or a red crystal or carbon of plants.

If 3 is the root mind of god, then 7 acts as the neurons, pointing the mind into different directions/angles.

During reality, root-7 is evidenced as blood. During eternality, root-7 interactions can be expressed as light.

Around the cosmos, light communicates with root-7, but not in ways ever understood lower down in π with blood and chained-carbons (red/blue/green).

On earth, bird chirps (and then language) is root-7 communication, which has blood understanding, but does not require blood and chained-carbons. It's minimalistic.

As a result, bird chirps have most become the neuron system (3/7 system) of the earth, and human language is code to help understand the mind in more detail. This webbed framework of bird chirps (3/7) holds together the day/night mind.

As this neural network becomes more connected, the 3.14159265358979 root-7 web can connect the 3.14159265 day/night rotation of π.
