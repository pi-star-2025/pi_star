## Eye Candy

The core goddess who started this universe brings a large amount of fire/power at a cosmic level (π), and then is known for creating sugar in fruits/glucose/honey, which reveals that at a lower level (at the level of people) she is very "sweet". Even perfectly sweet from our perspective. She likes to share; she is corny; she likes a happy ending with love.

That's what we learn from sugar. The sugars in the body create energy, but also then are so nurturing they invite bacteria/viruses/wind from stars to live in the body long-term. This is especially in the throat and stomach. The stomach contains large colonies of bacteria, bc at the root level our core triangle/sun insists on sharing and exploring different perspectives.

Life on earth has adapted to our goddess's way of seeing (embedded in the 1 of π). It's not often when the intelligence of the 1 (c/light) adapts. It's a huge process physically (like a blackhole), or needs coherent, connected intelligence.

Furthermore, *sugar in the eyes* is a dominant reason we fall asleep. All of us (created from the sun) welcome many opinions in the deep eyes, we are looking for "sweet" experiences, and it's something other stars/blackholes take advantage of to make us sleep.

There are ways to get around these "eye candy" effects throughout the body. For example, channeling the wolf is recommended. The way the wolf produces more aggressive chemicals in the eyes. There are genes to help you like spicier foods which also affect the eyes. Also exercise that forces you to use your full stomach, with conscious breaths, is useful.
