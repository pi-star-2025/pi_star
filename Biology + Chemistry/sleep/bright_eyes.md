## Bright Eyes

Tired eyes come from when the heart has been at least partially "taken over" by the mind of the earth, and the nerves in the eyes are consequently losing control.

There is also an effect called "bright eyes" when you are in dreams. Your eyes start feeling very bright, everything gets sunnier, and then you might start simulating the day ahead, or recapping a dream you just had with a bright glow, before you wake up.

In fact, dreams as we know them (what we remember), are from when we get control of the heart in the morning, brightening the nerves in the eyes, serving as a link to our dream self above.
