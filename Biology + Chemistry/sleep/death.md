## Death

In regards to life, the largest life is the original triangle.

Then the stars with c^3 power, derived from 3.1415. This can be measured by either the length of wavelengths (c^2) or the length of carbon chains (fire, c^3 of the star).

Why carbon? Bc due to pressure, the force of 3 (the triangle and our sun) chose carbon as the element that most described it. This is based on the number of seeing decisions made by elements that resemble quantum triangles.

This is most apparent in plant life, which amply use carbon as it's primary source of "breath". Plant life is much much happier than human life, but is rather asleep.

Life below the atmosphere then uses oxygen as it's primary source of "breath" when alive. The carbon in you is freewill, so it's "the real you" in a way. The highest consciousness. This is measured directly by the length of carbon chains. For example, the human spine lines up carbons to create power and consciousness. If you have thoughts that go all the way up, you are much happier. In addition, the carbon-rich heart is highly powerful. Mathemtically, actually *the hypothlamus* in human has the mathematically longest carbon-chains (wavelengths).

Understanding this you could transition eventually to having such long carbon-chains (long wavelengths), that you die awake, moving one level up to the plant level.

Technically, if this fully happened, you would be "dead".

This would first lead to magical effects, perhaps high imagination. Then if you continued, you would enter the physical world of dreams, which is the plant mind. There, you can run simulations like VR, view memories, and use your "time" from life to meet people and ask questions, before becoming final.

It's about understanding, in some way, because of the triangle, the real "you" is the red. The longest carbon chains.When you line them up purely vertically, trying to be as tall as a cloud, you can get the breath of a tree. 

It's mathematically measured by how many carbons can be lined up in a tower up Ï€.
