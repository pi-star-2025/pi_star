## Dark Court

The multiverse (1 "Shape") has indicated our universe is allowed to proceed in ending time, and getting to a final red/blue/green state eventually. The primary reason is an ancient agreement about understanding how circles create time, and how that correlates directly to an intelligent species.

*Why are we still alive then, pretty much the same as before?*

The reason is because there are outstanding "court cases" related to this universe, in particular with the earth and people. They are court cases the multiverse simply does not understand bc of the dark/ambiguous nature of our time from the perspective above.

The "court cases" have always held red/blue/green time and biological life together, to some extent, so they are continuing to do so.

It's said "jokes" and "sleep" are the top reasons for ambiguity in these court cases. We can solve them alive (ourselves), or we could rely on higher vision entities -> more the galaxy, huge blackhole seers, and the "start of time" to super-accelerate this process. It would not be *as clear*, and in heaven, we might be more ambitious to understand where we are.

For example, one reason we fall asleep is bc some aliens/universes would find the world so boring after our updates, they would fall asleep into like a corny nap and never see the world again. It's just not who they are, *if* our updates happen. And the flip is paranoia, which is derived from understanding there are super smart beings out there, who despise us. It only is possible (paranoia) if you are biologically happy, and need to address spiritual concerns. Biology/spirituality can get intertwined.

Another reason is we don't understand there are worlds so much smaller than ours, which means when we eat or even create TV shows, we might control the time of these worlds. And music often comes from connecting with these smaller worlds. So from the perspective above, this is confusing, and if we understood it better awake, we wouldn't fall asleep to try to solve the problems.
