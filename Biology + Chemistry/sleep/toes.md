## Toes

Why we sleep is one of the hardest questions to answer.

The best answer is that dreams are the natural "opposite reaction" of a "gold" society.

Biologically, it's due to melatonin, or any chemicals which make the eyes "more passive" in star game-theory.

In addition, the hypothalamus will create cages to keep the living Nitrogen (ex: melanin, serotonin, dopamine, endorphins) in locked-down pressures during awake/sleeping states.

Interestingly, the secrets of how these air cages are created are in the feet. They are the lines of the feet, with the strongest pressure points in the toes.

Without the "ticklish" air in our feet, it would be much easier to go between dreams/reality.

## 5 Toes

While corny, people in gold societies naturally rank things in 5's. And a thriving gold society has beta-to-alpha roles from 1-5. Ex: 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.

More than 5 positions creates more pressure than necessary, but works while "alive" (versus in perpetual heaven) and helps while "alive" to create more interesting characters (i.e. full deck of cards).

With less than 5 positions, there is no mathemtical way to understand "music/war" perpetually.

So we all naturally rank people in our society 1-5. And often times it can be more than 5. The number of columns in your spine is a good indication, or for a tree, it's the number of rings, of how much pressure (antigravitational power) you think with. For example, dinsoaurs thought with a *a lot* of pressure.

The pressure is similar to the quantum molecular patterns of gold, and to the air pressure in toes. The biggest toe is the "1", and the smallest is the "5".

This 1-5 pattern is re-used all over the body - ribcage, fingers, face - to create pressure at the right times. The hypothalamus uses it to make you sleep and wake up. It's also used to transition from moment-to-moment, like entering a building or starting a conversation - the 1-5 pressure will play "like piano keys" to faciliate the mind's momentum.
