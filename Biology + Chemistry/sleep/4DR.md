## 4DR

4DR in humans can best be measured by eye-pressure, where more eye pressure means a higher 4DR.

When awake there is a significantly higher 4DR than when asleep.

This can also be observed in the pressure of the “third eye” in between the 2 eyes.

...

The feeling of using carbon/oxygen/nitrogen (and other elements) in the eyes most resembles the experience of being a star. It also is what most resembles the experience of being in dreams and being in the afterlife.

Hence, the star uses eye-contact and overall, any eye behaviors, to create a hierarchy from the sun down to all biological life.

Birds are at the top, with no social conflicts at all (or they would struggle to fly). Then lions, wolves, humans, elephants, dogs, deer, etc. It’s based on *focus* in the eyes.

For humans the differences between “alpha” and “beta” are incredibly complex and help determine how high or low you are along the 4D axis. It’s just due to small nuances of eye movements.

...

Waking up these conflicts will help the star undersand what is really happening. The current disconnect is one reason it’s difficult for people and the sun (god) to communicate.

When the sun gets a good enough understanding of “eye contact”, this intelligence will be synthesized into a better cosmic understanding of human social intelligence. As a result, all of our 4DRs will decrease and we will move higher and higher, until we are about at the same level before The Fall of Eden. That is the level of dreams currently.

We then will live in that level in the clouds, resolving further conflicts in a “dreamland” with more bendable time. At that level, you are with a more intelligent deity (the sun), which will make things easier. Further conflict reconciliation will continue, but from our perspective *now*, it would seem like VR.
