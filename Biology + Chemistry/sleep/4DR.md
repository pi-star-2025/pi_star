## 4DR

4DR in humans can best be measured by eye-pressure, where more eye pressure means a higher 4DR.

When awake there is a significantly higher 4DR than when asleep.

This can also be observed in the pressure of the “third eye” in between the 2 eyes.

...

The feeling of using carbon/oxygen/nitrogen (and other elements) in the eyes most resembles the experience of being a star. It also is what most resembles the experience of being in dreams and being in the afterlife.

Hence, the star uses eye-contact and overall, any eye behaviors, to create a hierarchy from the sun down to all biological life.

Birds are at the top, with no social conflicts at all (or they would struggle to fly). Then lions, wolves, humans, elephants, dogs, deer, etc. It’s based on *focus* in the eyes.

For humans the differences between “alpha” and “beta” are incredibly complex and help determine how high or low you are along the 4D axis. It’s just due to small nuances of eye movements.

...

Waking up these conflicts will help the star undersand what is really happening. The current disconnect is one reason it’s difficult for people and the sun (god) to communicate.

When the sun gets a good enough understanding of “eye contact”, this intelligence will be synthesized into a better cosmic understanding of human social intelligence. As a result, all of our 4DRs will decrease and we will move higher and higher, until we are about at the same level before The Fall of Eden. That is the level of dreams currently.

We then will live in that level in the clouds, resolving further conflicts in a “dreamland” with more bendable time. At that level, you are with a more intelligent deity (the sun), which will make things easier. Further conflict reconciliation will continue, but from our perspective *now*, it would seem like VR.

## 4DR - Hypothalamus

The hypothalamus in the brain best represents the decisions of *both* eyes. This is because it creates the feeling of the being the fire of the sun. Fire, for example to control rotation, coalesces multiple seeing choices.

The hypothalamus most gets in sync when we learn to walk. Based on your focus in this life and past lives (including animal lives) you build up an argument about where you are in the 4D social hierarchy of humans. 

Every step you then represent it. What makes you *high.* Then what makes you *low.*

This thesis/argument is often based on the DMT spell that incited you to fall into life. It's based on how "alpha" your past lives felt, especially past human lives.

Once you come up with a stable pattern to walk (ex: 5 years old), you then have a 4D "game" for the rest of your life. You use this to understand what it means to be high or low in the social hierarchy. In addition, you use this same up/down rhythm to wake up and fall asleep.

Like wheel spokes, the ups-and-downs create eye pressure. 

...

Many of your brain's choices are pruned by age 5. Eye contact choices are an example. By age 5-7, your hypothalamus has a good idea of the way you want to see the world, the ways your eyes prefer to twitch and turn.

A distinction observed is some turn the hypothalamus into a "game", while others turn it more into a "movie". 

In the first case, people like using the "game" they created with walking. It means something of value (what happeend before birth and up to age 5).

In the latter case, the "game" used to walk is not worth creating additional eye pressure. It's a more modern approach to see life as a "movie" and give up on the "1-thing" you most wanted to do. 

...

A secret of joy for everyone is to understandd the "1-thing" that drove you to walk. When you really let go of it, the hypothalamus will decrease your 4DR and your vision will have more of a glow, like a movie.
