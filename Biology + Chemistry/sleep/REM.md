## REM Sleep

During the day, and often during the night, the 6D starmind is like a Pacman figure "eating" your time, at the speed of c. It goes up and down through the 6D mind, in addition to being the 4D soul inside your body. As a result, it always feels like you are working.

The exception is during REM sleep, when your eyes are liberated and aggressive enough to "eat" the 6D starmind. The 4D mind then does not listen to the continuous noise of the 6D starmind; instead the 4D mind sends a message to the 6D mind. 

Thus, during REM sleep, you create "transition" worlds or dream worlds, like pipes, into the 6D mind. After you die, you recycle these pipes, going back to the starmind.

By mimicking the activity of REM sleep in the third eye consciously, it is possible to "dream awake".
