## Straight Line

Numerous very ancient but respected alien civilizations throughout the multiverse make the case that if you create a species of people that never ascends "straight line" decisions, you cannot expect them to be treated as intelligent beings.

They even argue if you understand circles (Ï€), but still act in straight-line ways - for example, you truly cannot choose between waking/sleeping, then you are still un-intelligent, bc your mind does not have enough options for vision (each tick at c).
