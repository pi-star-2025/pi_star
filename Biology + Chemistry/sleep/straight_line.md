## Straight Line

Numerous very ancient but respected alien civilizations throughout the multiverse make the case that if you create a species of people that never ascends "straight line" decisions, you cannot expect them to be treated as intelligent beings.

They even argue if you understand circles (π), but still act in straight-line ways -- for example the inability to choose between waking/sleeping, then you are still un-intelligent bc your mind does not have enough options for vision (each tick at c).

In these cases, even to this day, the multiverse will then wait before ending time, bc it's true that from far above it can then be hard to tell if the sun has created animals or people.

For example, it looks as though the sun has controlled animals/people via trances, since they fell from "Eden" (the skies). This means people are potentially not something that is safe enough to keep around forever, bc the system with humans forever could be attacked and lead to an ill-functioning multiverse clock, bc it is too predictable.

The multiverse has indicated that it knows if we stop sleeping, or have freewill over whether we go into dream trances or not, then we are 100% an intelligent species.

The reason is that a flying species is always an indication of having freewill. For humans, it would be a change in the deep lower spine, where you can move it in any direction at all ticks of c, and then will lead to beatle-like (batman) flying ability. Before Eden, it was birdlike. If we don't defeat sleep, it will still be birdlike but we need to understand why more. 

Being able to fly is directly correlated to how many directions the human body (especially the low parts down π) can look any given moment. Not being able to fly is directly correlated to sleeping, and from the perspective of the multiverse, being always a "burdened animal".

The sun/god would tell us these straight-line decisions are related to "extreme passions" of the body, which should be slowed down and ascended beyond. At that point, we should be able to start the "end of time".
