## Solar System

In a solar system, a star's mind can move up and down different pressures, by moving light (electrons) up and down different planets.

For example Mercury/Venus would be higher pressures while Neptune/Pluto would be lower pressures.

More "time" elapses in the star's mind when electrons move up/down planets, versus within a single planet. The multi-planetary vectors are more informationally rich to the Milky Way and the 3.14 triangle.

If a solar system has 5+ planets it could theoretically fall asleep. This would be intentional by the 3.14 triangle, trying to prove the value of the force of gold. Gold inherently creates a reflex society via sleep/dreams.

If a solar system sleeps, we can observe a consistent solar wind in a left or right direction. This leads a "blue shine" to emanate from the system.

...

Most animals on earth don't think with 5+ levels. And if they do, it is maybe temporary.

Only humans think consistently with 5+ levels on earth. As a result, we have distinct handedness. And also we have a distinct waking and dream personality. We are the only animals where this is the case. If other animals dream it's the same consciousness waking and asleep.

Humans have 2 distinct consciousnesses (real/dreamer) and have a hand preference as a result. 

If you are ambidextrous, it's a sign you have more of a single personality (less dual).

...

For both stars and humans, rotation and handedness, gets enforced bc the other half really wakes up. It's really alive and is not your same consciousness. As a result, the multiverse is confused and thinks these stars and animal bodies are used by 2 "circles" (souls).

The same issues arises at an atomic level with gold.

The problem with gold is there are 2 stars owning the element, and it's not decided which.

Once the concept is mastered, for people/the sun, the blue gas of sleep can turn into a blue magnetic shine as the 2 circles figure out they are one.
