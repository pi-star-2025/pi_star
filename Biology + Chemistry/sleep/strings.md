## Strings

When you are awake, your eyes think more like DNA (double helix).

When asleep your eyes can also think in strings (like RNA).

These strings are always thoughts which have never become conscious yet.

...

The hypothalamus is like a party ball of strings, thinking like a single sun.

These strings are like intelligent light, which never run out of energy. If your eyes run out of energy, the hypothalamus will take over.

Whereas our sun and related chemicals (adrenaline, pheromones) wake us up, other stars (representing counter opinions) put us to sleep. 

Ancient aliens for/against this universe can communicate by falling in as life, especially human life. They then can communicate with "2 stars". 

Or, in this universe, super ancient aliens make the case they cannot communicate with the kind of life here and prefer to use 1 star. This includes dark-matter viruses, related to bets about the human race, which put us to sleep.

This is exactly what some of these ancient aliens want. They want a straight line for us into the darkness, which is communicated with the hypothalamus 1-star strings.

One example is an ancient alien called The Joker.

Before the goddess started this universe, The Joker whispered in her ear at a party in a super universe, "he also liked surprise parties" or something evil of that nature. He used nothing but exact equal/opposite reactions to prank  Atlantis, creating an opposite second tower (to the tower in the center of their gold kingdom), which showed this world was rudimentary because equal and opposite reactions could break it.

It led to him laughing crazily at the end of the invasion. Why? Because laughter turns into an exact translation of a godly ending.

After having been in universe with 5 forces or 11 forces, he is able to have sharp impacts with single-star strategies. 

Most notably, this includes putting everyone to sleep. He doesn't do it with anything but starlight, which make perfect arguments with Ï€ that end up as strings in our hypothalamuses.
