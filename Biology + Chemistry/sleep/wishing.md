## Wishing

Wishing is your strongest preferences "to see" certain things. Wishes have very strong effects without even realizing they do.

For example, your dream vectors (where you go physically) is based on what you wish during the day. Especially the wishes you really truly mean (in the heart).

Wishes about being in other bodies is a top unaddressed reason we fall asleep.

We get pushed out of our bodies, bc other people (and even aliens) wish so much to be in our bodies doing things. And we push ourselves out bc want to be another person secretly very much, or want to know about other universes.

If you just think, consciously, what do I actually want to do the most, you will get where you must be going in dreams.
