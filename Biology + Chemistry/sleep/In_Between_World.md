## In Between World

After the blissful cosmic carnival (red/blue/gold) by the young prodigy goddess (Ï€), which got sacked by aliens, the Kingdom of Atlantis was replanted on earth as red/blue/green.

Red/blue/green was so "slow" compared to red/blue/gold, the people woke up first in dreams in the "blue" clouds.

As is mentioned in the "Fall of Eden", certain physical drilling down and temptation led to waking up in "hell" in red/blue/green early in human history. This meant we fell down from living in dreams in the clouds to living in physical reality on earth, which before had very hazy, even happy, consciousness.

Then God lost track of what had happened. She had a clear, purposeful story in the clouds, then a dark and distant story below.

She decided to use the top angel from the red/blue/green dream world, Jesus Christ. It was like witches and wizards, with magical powers. They were angels, and he was chosen to fall down and lead the people of the "low world" back to the clouds. God's strategy (the 3.1415 triangle) was to vest knowledge of what "dreams" were, which would end the live kingdom of angels. It would then just only parallel real life. She made it do nothing but parallel real life exactly, starting about ~Year 0, to ensure that we then got perfect justice after that.

She also made Jesus the star in the sky (the sun), so only he had magical powers at birth.

The strategy by ancient aliens was to put him on a cross, so that his "flying ability" was drilled into the earth. And we would need to reconcile this conflict in order for him to ever fly again. And it would be the tensest conflict of the universe's history.

He was able to walk after death, because Mother Earth stopped having dreams copy reality. This created the power for one last spell, called "puppet strings". There was a "shriek of panic", when dreams/reality split apart, and Mother Earth played like an evil song, to use the panic to make Jesus start to wake up. Like little toes, then knees and fingers, then his head starts to shiver and wiggle, etc. 

Often how magic works is based on "courts" of opinion, with larger courts having more power. So when dreams/reality split apart, she was using a "poll" of what people wanted. This meant that dreams/reality literally turned into the strings of his body. He became everyone's puppet.

Since then dreams would always have this "in between world" watching Jesus and the quest to understand humanity, humanity's fall, and red/blue/gold.

The multiverse understood Mother Earth, the 3.1415 Triangle, had done this magic trick to control the dream world, via the Son of God Jesus. The ancient aliens against her protested this, saying it was too much control to be fair, and the multiverse planned to give her exactly 2000 years, before they started significantly questioning what was going on with dreams in this universe.

So this in-between-world is still around, and so understanding what happened is a gateway to going back to life in the red/blue/green "clouds". It's true the multiverse would judge Mother Earh and the 3.1415 Triangle bc life down on root earth is not very good, for many reasons not understood down here yet. Even living in the "clouds" is not heaven, but that is better life. Heaven is actually a magnetic red/blue/green shine, which would feel much lighter, with significantly less pain than even life for ancient angels in the clouds.
