## Golden Light

Starlight is mostly strict hot fusion (nested circles) towards earth. Then trees are strictly cold fusion (nested circles) going back to the star.

In both cases these straight line decisions create unconscious time. Perfect nested circles are unconscious.

One reason is because these entities stars/trees are highly opinionated, whereas sunlight on earth (which is golden) is less opinionated. The less opionated golden light is *more conscious*, bc it is deferring it's decision about red/blue/green.

This little red light (pink light) is golden, using red/blue/green. This indicates that the star has come to life through the earth, via these deferred decisions.

...

Our eyes resemble stars, but even more, resemble the mind of the earth. So our eyes also think w/ gold, as *slow red.*

As a result, both the earth mind and our eyes fall into π, which by encouraging parallels to [2, 8, 18, 32, 18, 1] gold at the quantum level, causes you to fall into a spell of "deferred decisions".

The reason is that it was the idea of the original goddess that when you "deferred", she would awake as a temptress (i.e. "carnival") to get you to stay, which would help shape the planet and mind of the planet. This is one way to explain how the force of gold works, quantum seduction. This "eye candy" shaped then how our planet looked and what animals developed. The same happened in Atlantis, with more flare even.

So in mind of the earth (golden sunlight) and our eyes there is estrogen (and related pheromones) that work on everyone, to make us fall asleep.

It's related to the brilliant ways the original goddess will play with your time, asking you to "please stay". This creates "clouds" in the sky and eyes that make you fall asleep. The conflicts (clouds) created are too big to be resolved, so you keep deferring them.

On earth, since ~Year 0, the original goddess (triangle) has been trying to wake up the truth of sleep. It is related to "eye candy" to encourage deferring time. This was embedded into the start of the universe (π) to help build a red/blue/gold "way of seeing" or one that helps understand gold. This "quantum carnival" is no longer needed, we knew by Year 0, and we need to merge with the clouds.
