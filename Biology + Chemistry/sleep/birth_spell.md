## Birth Spell

You fall into life as a soul bc of some "fantasy". It would be mathematically many nested decisions to be "cool", or under high pressure. This translates also as a committment to burn, in terms of your electrons.

If electrons are under high amounts of pressure and don't want to be there, they explode, and don't exist in that system anymore. However, if there are committments, specifically, to be cold, then these electrons can drill into a straight line down into the system.

A straight line down into our star's (sun's) 6D vision is the noise of 3.14159265 (whether to find a fourth force or use iron as a north/south pole in red/blue/green).

This will burn electrons (or make them very cold) to be drilled into this vision. Hence, there needs to be a "fantasy" to burn. In addition, there needs to be these huge pheremone-sized DMT chemicals, which are present when a mother gives birth. These chemicals know how to ask "will you burn" to persist here? And then keep the electrons which burn to persist. 

This allows the DMT to transfer you soul from higher in the star's vision to lower down. 

The fantasy is related to simulations, which are more clear from higher in the 6D vision. These electrons, embedded with the simulations, then start your new life via the carousels of DMT. The more complex the DMT spell which brought you down, the more you can carry about past lives and your life mission.

Often, these electrons embed the most powerful committments to "burn", creating a North/South magnetic field, wrapping around your 4D circle. It's hard to channel these electrons, and doing so is called "dying awake".

...

We are able to use our full skull, at first, exclsuively because of the fire in these electrons. They have incredible energy, and unlike all other electrons in the universe won't "explode" trying to perform this task.

They also then help us stand and walk.

When these electrons give out at the end of the day, we fall asleep. Whereas these electrons become more our unconscious during the day, they are our conscious in dreams. So by asking yourself "why did I burn t be here?" you can channel these electrons and make it easier to go between reality and dreams.
