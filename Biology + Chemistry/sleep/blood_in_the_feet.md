## Blood in the Feet

Blood in the feet is a primary reason we sleep, it's been observed.

This would be blood in the deepest parts of the feet (what would be the most ticklish). 

The blood deep in the feet is not well understood and connected consciously, and it's a quantum rhythm for it to then be observed unconsciously.

The reason is bc the blood in the feet is powered by the sun during the day. 

What is ticklish in the body is not understood well by us, bc we don't understand the firepower of the star which vows to criss-cross the heart so many times in order to power our human feet. 

We will understand in the future is the star's promise. So that is alluded to when the sun makes Jesus walk - after his friends took him out of a tomb after death.

Then what is funny to us is not understood well by god - it tickles the mind of the sun, bc the sun moves too fast to understood how all these "little things" affect our lives so much.

...

So by understanding better why we cross ourselves up so much in our hearts to power walking, we can then require less sleep.

And by slowing down jokes, and almost teaching the star what you mean, you also will require less sleep.
