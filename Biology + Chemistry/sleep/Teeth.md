## Choke

All living circles/triangles in the multiverse need to potentially account for time where they use "teeth" with "high taste".

This means purposely drilling in back and forth, like physical teeth/bones/roots, which mathematically gives all life fun/pleasure in the multiverse, but can be at the expense of other life. So until the multiverse understands what is going on, these "opposite reactions" of any kind of teeth behavior are associated with your soul/body.

For example, eating, drinking, urination, defecation, copulation use "teeth". Thinking/vision/hearing/smelling/speaking are elegant enough where they do not.

The opposite reactions of these teeth-driven behavior are recycled for choking, coughing, sneezing, vomiting, which have biological rhythms/benefits. So we are technically "on trial" for these behaviors, in ways our universe doesn't even know yet how to account for. But in the mean time, we use these opposite reactions practically.

The size of our teeth is said to be high for a 3-force universe, pretty high. But still nothing that seems higher than 3 forces.

## Clouds

Clouds in our eyes and the skies store larger conflicts regarding teeth. This is based on actions of people, gods, and societies throughout time.

In particular, the conflicts we are individually associated with, including from past lives, put us to sleep each night. So these are potential multiverse "court cases", which everyone accumulates. They are from moments where we have "drilled in" very hard to life on earth, and at night these moments (unconsciously) are drilling back in our heads.

This clearly happens to everyone, including animals.

Being honest about all multiverse court cases for people/gods help accelerate to the end of time and the end of sleeping.
