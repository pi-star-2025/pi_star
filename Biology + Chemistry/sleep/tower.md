## Tower

In the multiverse there is the concept of a "tower", which is a challenge that gets a people/society from reality to the after life.

It is a powerful concept, bc it focuses on what does this the fastest and most practically.

For example, understanding π is time will ultimately get us to the after life through equal and opposite reactions, but there is less a definite timeline to get there.

A "tower" (across the multiverse) focuses on what gets you to the after life the fastest. In a 3-force world, that is usually seen as optimal, especially in a world with high pain.

In our universe, at the present moment, the "tower" is overcoming sleep. It signifies high control of the eyes and heart.

Historically, nemeses of people would always "see" us in directions where we would always sleep, instead of involving more nocturnal traits.

As we overcome sleep more and more, it is a straight line to existing with less blood (more in the after life).
