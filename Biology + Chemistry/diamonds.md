## Octet rule anthropomorphized 

If you share “time”, you get to “see” more. 

This is evident at a molecular level, where atoms get to “see more” if they “share” electrons to always have 8 electrons in the outer most shell. 

This is bc the atoms then become more geometrically “3D” if they exist with 8 electrons, even it it’s via sharing (existing quantumly). 

So you don’t exist technically all the time with 8, but then the atoms organize more with the intent to see. 

…

Atoms tend to follow the octet rule, bc it mimics the personality of our goddess. 

1. She wants to see in “8 directions” like a spider
2. She likes to share, which is correlated to being “musical”. 

Not all other universes (and their systems of physics) would work this way, bc they don’t have the same “seer” of time.

Also, universes don't have the same kind of magic we used to...

## Magic Diamonds

The more you align your octet-based 8-eye vision *in a straight line*, in as efficient (circular) a space as possible

The more you reference whitehole and blackhole architecture

And the more seeing intelligence you have. 

The classic example of this is diamonds. 

It is like a tower, and as a result diamonds have linear but true ability to see. The vision is directly that of the star in a crystallized format, bc diamonds are carbon based.

Other stones, like certain crystals (ex lorandite) can nest more complicated star vision/intelligence. As a result, certain lorandite crystals can contain certain prophecies and predictions, but you need to somehow combine your “vision” with the “vision” of the crystal, considering that the “vision” of the earth/star is wrapped around both. So, you could use a godly story. It’s said that both Jesus and Alexander the Great’s “characters” have used such stones to see the future. 

It’s also true that certain stones could be used for more complicated magical spells, but only the *most intelligent* stones. They are rare, in developing such true neural-nets to the mind of the star. And in such cases, if the mind of you, others around you, the star/earth, and the stone are in sync enough, you can use the stones to have impacts on your physical surroundings. For example, you could create a forcefield, or change the weather in an area, or always have locusts swarming around a particular village.
